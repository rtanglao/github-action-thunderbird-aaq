If the account is IMAP, you can download all folders with File&gt;offline&gt;download (but you will need to verify that all messages downloaded and then exit Thunderbird and do a full backup for safety). The saved IMAP folders can then be reinstated by restoring to Thunderbird's local folder folder. The important thing is to make sure you have all messages saved and then, with thunderbird not running, do a full backup for your protection. I recommend doing at least two full backups. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It would be Interesting to know the type of computer, OS and version of Thunderbird that David is using. I am adding three screen shots to show what happens when I try to select, then drag and drop individual contacts to a list. The first shot shows a Contact List (“PHISHING”) selected. The second shot shows one email address selected (in a great big window that blocks out almost all of the list of addresses.) With difficulty, I can scroll down the list above that window and click on other entries, and the third shot shows what happens when, with Ctrl key held down, I tried to drag and drop (four) addresses to another Contact List. The  red circle with oblique line through it suggests to me that it not only doesn't work but isn't meant to. Perhaps someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong? </p><p>The good news for me is that in doing these shots, my second problem (""Send Via the Address Book"") has been answered – but not in the way described in the article that I referenced (a way that used to work.) To select the complete Contact List, it is necessary to  - click on the Contact List  - Click on one of the entries displayed in the list, (when Write appears – see shot 2) then  - Ctrl/A to select the whole list. - then click on Write. </p>",EmmBee,false,0,0
