If the account is IMAP, you can download all folders with File&gt;offline&gt;download (but you will need to verify that all messages downloaded and then exit Thunderbird and do a full backup for safety). The saved IMAP folders can then be reinstated by restoring to Thunderbird's local folder folder. The important thing is to make sure you have all messages saved and then, with thunderbird not running, do a full backup for your protection. I recommend doing at least two full backups. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
