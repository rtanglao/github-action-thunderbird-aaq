Thunderbird can run without accounts. And, although you state that you installed the importexport addon, you didn't use it, choosing instead to use the default import. Try using the importexport menu option under tools, and there happens to be a menu option called import mbox file.

The problem continues though substantially improved which I think may be because I'm now on a bigger monitor.

The picky is to say that if I hesitate over a file for way under a second the dialogue assumes that's the folder I want ... which brings me to the sticky.  That is when I do pause momentarily over the wrong folder it seems to become stuck there and I have to back out with the escape key back to the action/folder allocation start (i.e. I can't just back up one level if I've gone into a level of my folder hierarchy, I have to back right out of that and start it over again).

I do have 54 email accounts currently, and maybe 600,000 messages; with the sorting rules, starting over is a little tedious. Looks like I will have to do this one way or another. Not being a pro or anything, I am thinking that something in this version is linking to something in an old version, and that must be the problem.

Obviously none of these worked. I suppose if I read a couple million lines of the code I could figure this out. Just hoping I get lucky and someone knows how to make passwords work.

Over the years, Thunderbird makes changes and has code in place during the early stages of a release. By not keeping up, you can end up with a cumbersome upgrade approach.

In order for passwords to work in Thunderbird, I should uninstall the version I have, then research how many ""series"" there are, then download these old versions, then upgrade progressively to the latest version.

Note that I have already upgraded, so there is no way to tell what remains of the original versions or what files are causing the problem (I already deleted all the common culprits that are recommended to eliminate). I realize this is an open source software, built on the backs of volunteers, but this method seems like a sure-fire way to eliminate old users.
