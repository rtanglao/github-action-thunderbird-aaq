A few more questions to try to help me get this resolved.  1) When I went to the new Computer, Microsoft forced my User to be regis rather than LWS which was on my old computer - Would that have cause a problem when moving my profile over? 2) I just noticed that in the Profiles folder there are just two items - a folder named 7qmxwt13.default-release and a CSV file named Collected Addresses. Should the CSV file be in the 7qmxwt13.default-release folder? 3) In the 7qmxwt13.default-release folder I see 2 abook files, but no address files. Is this where I should copy the abook folders from the old computer? Is Windows File Manager the same thing I call Windows Explorer that I use to find and move, copy, delete, rename files etc.  Thanks again </p>",LWSiegel,false,0,0
