Now things are back to normal with the inbox for the email address which initially had the problem. But the same problem has now somehow ""transferred"" to the inbox of a different email address! That is, when I try to delete (or move) a message from there I get a ""Not Responding"" message and then a long delay before it finally deletes (or moves). </p><p>Your first suggestion, though, does seem to temporarily fix things---disabling the anti-virus. But for obvious reasons I don't want to have to take that step each time I want to delete (or move) a message. </p><p>Do you have any suggestions? </p><p>Again, many thanks. </p><p>Andrew </p>",Bartholo,false,0,0

Antivirus scanning locking out the file. (simple expedient of restarting in safe mode with Networking will remove that.) 2. The actual storage file having issues with regard to corruption or allocation.  Generally you needs to use the system utilities to ""de-fragment"" the file system as that will identify file system errors. 3. An oauth authentication window open in the background.  Hover your mouse over the icon on the task bar and see if there is a second window showing open.  Just about everything fails when there is an ""enter credentials"" windows open including getting mail 4. An addon might be the issue.  Restart from the help menu in troubleshooting mode and continue when prompted.  Does that change anything? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,0
