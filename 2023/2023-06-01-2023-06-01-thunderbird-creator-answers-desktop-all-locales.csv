Despite following the installation steps carefully, the addon doesn't seem to work properly, in fact doesn't appear as an option when I try to add an account. I've tried reinstalling Thunderbird and the addon multiple times, but with no success. </p><p>I was wondering if anyone else has encountered a similar problem or has any idea why this might be happening specifically on Windows. Are there any additional configurations or dependencies required for the addon to work on Windows?
