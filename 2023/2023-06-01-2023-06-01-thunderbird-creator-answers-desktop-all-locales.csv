I am currently facing an issue with installing the Owl for Exchange addon on Thunderbird for Windows. I have successfully installed it on Linux, but unfortunately, I'm unable to replicate the process on my Windows machine. </p><p>The purpose of installing this addon is to synchronize my institutional Outlook account with Thunderbird. Despite following the installation steps carefully, the addon doesn't seem to work properly, in fact doesn't appear as an option when I try to add an account. I've tried reinstalling Thunderbird and the addon multiple times, but with no success. </p><p>I was wondering if anyone else has encountered a similar problem or has any idea why this might be happening specifically on Windows. Are there any additional configurations or dependencies required for the addon to work on Windows? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>Thank you in advance for your assistance! </p><p>Best regards, </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",davidrojaslizama
