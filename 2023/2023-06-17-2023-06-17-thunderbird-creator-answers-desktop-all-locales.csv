Recently, I somehow fat-fingered something I was typing and all of my inbox folders disappeared, including 3 accounts and a number of subjects within the accounts.  Now, when I get messages, the bar at the bottom says I have received a new one from one of my two accounts, but nothing shows up, so I can't read anything.  It's probably a one-keystroke command, but I don't know how to correct it, and in the meantime Thunderbird is unusable. </p><p>How can I correct this?  Is there a way, in future, that I can prevent single-keyastroke commands from destroying my program's organization? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",pete.n4zr

At the time, many of my email accounts were storing the mail on that disk.  I've copied all the files off to a working disk and dumped the old disk.  I changed Thunderbird to point to the new location.  Now, all of the accounts are working again, except one (using POP).  Thunderbird simply won't check email on that account, and the last email shown is 4 days ago.  When I click Get Messages and select the account, nothing seems to happen.  Nothing shows up in the Activity Manager.  The account is definitely working on the server-side, as I can view it in K-9 on my phone, and another account on the same POP server is working fine in Thunderbird.  Outgoing email on the account sends fine. </p><p>I've tried various suggestions, including wiping my password database (Thunderbird did not prompt me for that account) but nothing seems to make a difference.  I wonder if it's to do with the Inbox (which is a hefty 7GB mbox file).  I tried Repair Folder on the Inbox but it did not make a difference; Thunderbird still won't check the email.  I did briefly try renaming the Inbox file to Old-Inbox but Thunderbird still wouldn't check the email.  I want to make sure I retain all my old emails (they are all showing, so it doesn't look like the file got corrupted).  Does anyone have any suggestions for how to get the email working again without losing all the mailboxes? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1585948;1585950;1585951;1585953;,neil__b
