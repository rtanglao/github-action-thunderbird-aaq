We didn't make any software changes but we did send out a large, blast email campaign Tuesday, (as we do every month), and there were probably some SPAM reports as a result. The reason I am looking for help with Thunderbird is that I sent an email to one of my employees as a test through webmail and it went right through. Then sent the exact same email from Thunderbird and it bounced. However, this email bounce to multiple employees below was sent through webmail.
