And I always suggest NOT including password when setting up the account. And use OAUTH2. If all goes well, Google will immediately pop up a request to login to Gmail. Once that happens, Google will update the Thunderbird password with a unique passcode that applies explicitly to you and the PC and the account. That is, it will be a password that is useless anywhere else.  </p><p>And, uh...  if this works, I think I'm entitled to two shots of George Dickel. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I doubt that it is an IMAP provider issue because the holder relates to outlook.office365 and Microsoft prodded around my computer for about four hours and you would think that they would know if their IMAP servers were preventing it deletion. I deliberately refrained from mentioning the folder names because they are in Italian and I think that would likely lead us into blind alleyways. However for your info  the folders are Problemi di sincronizzazione, errori locali, errori server and conflitti. I suspect that they are office 365 app folders which may have been installed when I bought a recent Home and Student Office 2021  licence (from Microsoft). Where the Italian folders came drom I have no idea as I didn't install any Italian version although I have dabbled in Italian in the distant past but I think the Italian-ness would be a red herring </p>",ray.pioli,false,0,0

They are generally harmless and success in removing them might compromise the email service.

If it's addressbooks that didn't get transferred, you might look in prior profile for files beginning with the letters 'abook' and copy them (when Thunderbird is not running) into the current profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
