And I always suggest NOT including password when setting up the account. And use OAUTH2. If all goes well, Google will immediately pop up a request to login to Gmail. Once that happens, Google will update the Thunderbird password with a unique passcode that applies explicitly to you and the PC and the account. That is, it will be a password that is useless anywhere else.  </p><p>And, uh...  if this works, I think I'm entitled to two shots of George Dickel. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I have also seen positive comments here from Owl users. I think there is a 30-day trial. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

They are generally harmless and success in removing them might compromise the email service. However, you never mentioned the names of the folders; knowing that may cause a better response to appear here. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Sounds like it's loading wicked slow, and takes time to replace the folders label.  </p><p>I have seen where a disk had bad sectors and thunderbird just happened to be loaded in some of them, so it acted weird.  </p><p>I'd first do a few things to the computer, to be sure it's OK.  </p><p>Run a chkdsk /f/x/r to fix and replace bad sectors in an Admin Command Prompt. This takes a while to run.  Then check for and install Windows updates.  Then run sfc /scannow  in an Admin Command Prompt - This checks and fixes windows files.  </p><p>After you're sure the system is working fine, do a search for ""Thunderbird Repair"". There is a page to help find possible solutions there. </p>",Chicks_Hate_Me,false,0,0
