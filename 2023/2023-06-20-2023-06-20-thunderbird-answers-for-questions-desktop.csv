I doubt that it is an IMAP provider issue because the holder relates to outlook.office365 and Microsoft prodded around my computer for about four hours and you would think that they would know if their IMAP servers were preventing it deletion. I deliberately refrained from mentioning the folder names because they are in Italian and I think that would likely lead us into blind alleyways. However for your info  the folders are Problemi di sincronizzazione, errori locali, errori server and conflitti. I suspect that they are office 365 app folders which may have been installed when I bought a recent Home and Student Office 2021  licence (from Microsoft). Where the Italian folders came drom I have no idea as I didn't install any Italian version although I have dabbled in Italian in the distant past but I think the Italian-ness would be a red herring </p>",ray.pioli,false,0,0

I am surprised you haven't gotten an email from the host saying you email account is near full.  </p><p>You may have to actually; </p><p>1. Log into the email servers account to delete all of the emails you thought you deleted through Thunderbird, and while at it check the other folders there. Sometimes there are folders on the email servers that aren't shown through Thunderbird. </p><p>2.  Control what happens when you delete an email through Thunderbird.  Go to <strong>ACCOUNT SETTINGS - SERVER SETTINGS</strong> under your email account in Thunderbird and look for <strong>When I delete a message:</strong>  I set this to ""Move it to this folder""  and set the folder to ""Trash on ~MyEmailsTrashFolder~.  But you will have to empty that from time to time.  </p><p>Have you emptied your folder called ""Deleted""? </p><p>3. You are keeping a lot of folders in your email account. That's good if you need to access them from anywhere and any system. I only need to access then from my Home computer after a while, so I create <strong>LOCAL</strong> folders for organization and drag them off the server and save them locally.  This reduces my need to get online.  </p><p>You seem better than me at limiting the # of folders too. Good Job haha. I JUST created a NEW Profile to clean up things... </p><p>Having everything saved locally, seems to make Thunderbird faster for me too, as I don't have to go online to see them. But, as I said, if you need access from multiple devices, you need to keep them at the email server.  </p><p>Hope you figure it out... </p><p>Good Luck!!! </p>",Chicks_Hate_Me,false,0,0
