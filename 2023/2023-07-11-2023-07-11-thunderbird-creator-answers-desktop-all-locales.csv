Drafts are saved locally on my computer. If you write a letter for a long time, then periodically displays a sign: ""Could not save the message as a draft. Error sending the message."" Forced saving a draft is also not possible with the same message. Thunderbird software version 102.13.0 (64 bit). Despite the fact that it cannot save a draft, the program freely allows you to drag and copy messages into the Drafts folder. If you create a new POP3 account, then there is no error with drafts. Please help. What can be done? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",weandi

It bothers me because I have a habit of hitting the enter button when doing any kind of search, even though its not necessary for quick filter.  Every time this comes up and I hit the enter key it opens a new tab which is not what I want.  Please tell me there is some kind of advanced configuration tweak that will either break or disable this unwanted feature. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",gsrgtrdg4565653

Can someone please advise me, bearing in mind I am 76 years old and not an expert in these matters. This is the first time in the 12 years with Thunderbird that I have had this problem.

This includes an 'All Mail' and a 'Archives' folder. For reasons that should be obvious, I only want the one called 'Archives' to be included in the archives unified folder. Unfortunately Thunderbird is automatically including both of these folders in the unified archives folder. I can open the unified folder properties and unselect the 'All Mail' folder from the search options, however the folder is still shown as one of the subfolders in the unified archives folder. </p><p>How can I actually get Thunderbird to remove this subfolder from its unified archives? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",firefox2377

This should be either automatically the same address the email was sent to or at least optionally selectable choice in preferences instead just always using my default email address. </p><p>Longer version: 1) I order something from Acme Inc. I give them my alias email in format of user@acmeinc.domain.etc.  2) there is an issue with the order. Acme Inc contacts me by sending email to user@acmeinc.domain.etc 3) I get the email. I reply by pressing the reply option in Thunderbird 4) Thunderbird sets my sender address as user@domain.etc instead of using the email address user@acmeinc.domain.etc the email was sent to 5) Before sending the email I will have to manually go and type in the address that I want to use so that a) my actual email address is revealed to automatic systems b) I can potentially be able to see who leaked my email address and where (marketing, spam, ..) </p><p><strong>The format of the email address is not an issue. The email address used when replying is.</strong> </p><p>Please make it so, that when pressing the reply button the same email address the message was sent to will be used by default, or atleast add this as an option for the user to select in the preferences. </p><p>The fact that email programs have junk (e)mail options does not remove the fact that junk mail still happens and the actual solution is to remove unwanted junk at the server, not the client level (we have many, many, nice devices, don't we). </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",skape
