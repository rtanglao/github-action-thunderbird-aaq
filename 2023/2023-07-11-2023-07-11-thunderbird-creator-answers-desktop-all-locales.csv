It has stopped working.,"<p>Since I updated from Ubuntu 20 to Ubuntu 22.04, Thunderbird has become unstable when using a wacom-style tablet: every time I try to drag and drop an email, it crashes. It also doesn't respond well to the wacom pen buttons. Other software seems to work well. I tried safe mode disabling all add-ons, and same result.  On the terminal, I see this error when it happens:  </p><p>[Parent **, Main Thread] WARNING: gdk_wayland_window_get_wl_surface: assertion 'GDK_IS_WAYLAND_WINDOW (window)' failed: 'glib warning', file /build/thunderbird-pdSW0V/thunderbird-102.11.0+build1/toolkit/xre/nsSigHandlers.cpp:167 </p><p>(thunderbird:**): Gdk-CRITICAL **: ***: gdk_wayland_window_get_wl_surface: assertion 'GDK_IS_WAYLAND_WINDOW (window)' failed [GFX1-]: Wayland protocol error: error marshalling arguments for start_drag (signature&nbsp;?oo?ou): null value passed for arg 1 </p><p>[GFX1-]: Wayland protocol error: Error marshalling request: Invalid argument </p><p>Gdk-Message: ***: Error 22 (Invalid argument) dispatching to Wayland display.

I don’t see the point in getting a notification about a message more than once.  Obviously, TB does flag ‘newness’ as well as ‘unread’ so it would be best if notifications took ‘newness’ into account. </p><p>Even if notifications do rely on a message being ‘unread’, Google’s IMAP folder system makes sure that messages appear in more than one place, which seems to make Thunderbird give you more than one notification.  Is there any way to restricting what folders TB looks in for new messages to notify you about? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",seanos

Drafts are saved locally on my computer. If you write a letter for a long time, then periodically displays a sign: ""Could not save the message as a draft. Error sending the message."" Forced saving a draft is also not possible with the same message. Thunderbird software version 102.13.0 (64 bit). Despite the fact that it cannot save a draft, the program freely allows you to drag and copy messages into the Drafts folder. If you create a new POP3 account, then there is no error with drafts.

This includes an 'All Mail' and a 'Archives' folder. For reasons that should be obvious, I only want the one called 'Archives' to be included in the archives unified folder.

This should be either automatically the same address the email was sent to or at least optionally selectable choice in preferences instead just always using my default email address. </p><p>Longer version: 1) I order something from Acme Inc. I give them my alias email in format of user@acmeinc.domain.etc.  2) there is an issue with the order. Acme Inc contacts me by sending email to user@acmeinc.domain.etc 3) I get the email. I reply by pressing the reply option in Thunderbird 4) Thunderbird sets my sender address as user@domain.etc instead of using the email address user@acmeinc.domain.etc the email was sent to 5) Before sending the email I will have to manually go and type in the address that I want to use so that a) my actual email address is revealed to automatic systems b) I can potentially be able to see who leaked my email address and where (marketing, spam, ..) </p><p><strong>The format of the email address is not an issue. The email address used when replying is.</strong> </p><p>Please make it so, that when pressing the reply button the same email address the message was sent to will be used by default, or atleast add this as an option for the user to select in the preferences. </p><p>The fact that email programs have junk (e)mail options does not remove the fact that junk mail still happens and the actual solution is to remove unwanted junk at the server, not the client level (we have many, many, nice devices, don't we). </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",skape
