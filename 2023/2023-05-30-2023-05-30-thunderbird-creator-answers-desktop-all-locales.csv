Recently after power cycling my PC both Firefox Version 113.0.2 and Thunderbird Version 102.11.2 when launched, indicate that they have never been set up.  Each programs respective Profile ""????????.default"" directory contain an additional file named  ""Invalidprefs.js"".  Each time this occurs, I can resolve it by erasing the entire contents of the ""????????.default"" directory and copy the entire contents of a good profile directory from an earlier backup.  This issue started happening around the second week of May.  I have been using both Firefox and Thunderbird for about 20 years and never had an issue.  It appears to be related to the recent updates that where released. </p><p>I have had Firefox Version 113.0.2 running on my laptop which has Windows 11, 64 bit without issue.  I installed Thunderbird Version 102.11.2 onto this laptop to see if it had the same issue as the Windows 10 desktop system.  So far it works just fine. </p><p>Please let me know if you need additional information.  I do not want want to run Thunderbird on my laptop permanently.  I have considered downgrading Firefox to Version 112.0.2 and Thunderbird to 102.10.1 on the desktop.  Rather not go though the extra work to downgrade if I don't have to. </p><p>Thank you </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",draket

I have installed Thunderbird 102.11.2. Both of these are latest versions. In System Settings, I cannot adjust the Notifications for Thunderbird - everything is switched on and I cannot change that (see first uploaded image). I have also tried the Settings pane in Thunderbird itself. Although I have unchecked all of  the Notifications boxes (see second uploaded image), I continue to get all notifications - banners, alerts and sounds. I do not want all these things as it disturbs me while I am working. Am I doing something wrong or is there a bug in the system? On my previous Macbook I could control the Thunderbird notifications.
