I have installed Thunderbird 102.11.2. Both of these are latest versions. In System Settings, I cannot adjust the Notifications for Thunderbird - everything is switched on and I cannot change that (see first uploaded image). I have also tried the Settings pane in Thunderbird itself. Although I have unchecked all of  the Notifications boxes (see second uploaded image), I continue to get all notifications - banners, alerts and sounds. I do not want all these things as it disturbs me while I am working. Am I doing something wrong or is there a bug in the system? On my previous Macbook I could control the Thunderbird notifications.
