You do need to have the email account first, and then use Thunderbird to manage it. Here are general steps: - be sure to use the standard release version, which is currently at version 102. (f what you downloaded is higher than 103, you may have downloaded the beta version). - when thunderbird starts, it prompts you for information on your email account. you need to have to set up the account, and that is provided to you by the website where you signed up for the email account. Thunderbird knows the settings for commonly used accounts, such as gmail.  - you need to first decide whether you want the account set up as IMAP (all messages remain on the server) or as POP (messages are downloaded to PC). That is the first decision to be made in setting up the account. If you use the account from more than one device (such as PC and phone, or home PC and work PC), then IMAP is recommended.  </p><p>Okay, from here on, you can ask questions for more specifics as you go. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

You can have any number of profiles and can switch between them as desired. To create a new profile, click help&gt;moretroubleshootinginformation, scroll down to Profiles, click 'about:profiles, then click 'create profiles' button, then next, then enter a name for the profile, e.g., hotmail, then click Finish. With that you will be in a new profile and can create your hotmail account.  </p><p>Having written the above, you would generally be safe to add the hotmail account to existing profile, as Thunderbird keeps all accounts separate. For your protection, you could create a backup of the profile , either with tools&gt;export (if your profile is smaller than 2 gig), or with the importexport addon. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
