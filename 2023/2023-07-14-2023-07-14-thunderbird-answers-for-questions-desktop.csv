They are well known to cause such issues. </p><p>The garbage appearance can usually be mitigated by right clicking the folder selecting properties and then the repair button (that rebuilds the message index only).  But it is probably better in the long term to put an exception in your anti virus for scanning in the Thunderbird profile folder while it is running. </p><p>My understanding of the u0pdating of the day in calendar is it is a bug that is being addressed,  until them you will need to restart Thunderbird each day to force the issue. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
