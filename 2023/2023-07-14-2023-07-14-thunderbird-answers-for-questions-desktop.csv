When the form gives me the option of using my existing email address, does it mean the address I've been using with another service? </blockquote> <p>Yes it does. </p> <blockquote>  I'm getting an alert that says: ""Unable to log in at server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password. </blockquote> <p>For the big players like outlook, yahoo GMS etc generally that error means your antivirus product is blocking the connection to the internet.  For more esoteric providers it can mean what it says.. </p> <blockquote> (2) I thought I was already logged in. However, the page I saw looked nothing at all like the page shown in ""Getting Started with the Thunderbird main window (Supernova and newer)."" (See attachment.) So the instructions in that article were of no use.  </blockquote> <p>As you have not configured an account successfully then the application has nothing to show you and can not interact with your mails so can't build list or import your contacts. </p> <blockquote> In short, I'm completely at sea. I would like to try Thunderbird, but have no idea how to get started. I'm obviously doing something wrong. </blockquote> <p>Well move back to creating or adding your account to Thunderbird.  That is the first and most important step. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

They are well known to cause such issues. </p><p>The garbage appearance can usually be mitigated by right clicking the folder selecting properties and then the repair button (that rebuilds the message index only).  But it is probably better in the long term to put an exception in your anti virus for scanning in the Thunderbird profile folder while it is running. </p><p>My understanding of the u0pdating of the day in calendar is it is a bug that is being addressed,  until them you will need to restart Thunderbird each day to force the issue. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I use the option in the filters dialog,  that way I can select the filter to run and the folder I want to use. </p><p>However it is still on the classic menu bar,  just not the ""app"" menu.  Press F10 to see the classic menu bar. (I always have it turned on.)
