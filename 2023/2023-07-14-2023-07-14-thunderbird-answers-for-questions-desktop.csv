Avevo letto degli Aggiornamenti ancora disponibili per la 102, ho voluto testare la 115, essendo amante delle novità&nbsp;:) Vediamo se qualcuno può rispondermi, scriverò anche sul Forum Italiano. Però, a questo punto, potresti dirmi come le sposteresti tu, senza considerare i Lettori di Schermo? Descrivilo, se puoi, in dettaglio, intanto io mi interfaccio con i vedenti sempre e dunque conosco Mouse e posso anche provare a simularlo da tastiera.

However, the page I saw looked nothing at all like the page shown in ""Getting Started with the Thunderbird main window (Supernova and newer)."" (See attachment.) So the instructions in that article were of no use.  </blockquote> <p>As you have not configured an account successfully then the application has nothing to show you and can not interact with your mails so can't build list or import your contacts. </p> <blockquote> In short, I'm completely at sea.
