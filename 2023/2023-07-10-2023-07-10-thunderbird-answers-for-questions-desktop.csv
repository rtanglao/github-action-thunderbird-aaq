My way of doing this is simple: I select the message(s) I want to archive, right-click and select ""Copy to,"" and choose one of the folders I've created under Local Folders. Then I delete the message from the Inbox, and later, when I close down for the night, I empty the trash. That leaves only one copy of each copied message on my computer, and no copies of it on the server. Thunderbird has a neat trick to speed this process up for you: when you copy a message to one of your local folders, TB will add an item to the right-click menu that says ""Copy to folder X again"" where ""folder X"" is the name of the folder you last copied a message to. The next time you want to archive a message to that folder, you have a built-in command right in the menu. So, it's just a two-step process: ""Copy to"" and ""Delete."" But don't forget the trash. Your server will keep deleted messages in its Trash folder for quite a while, until/unless you delete them from that folder. And the easy way to do that trick once a day is to right-click on the Trash icon in Thunderbird and choose Empty the Trash. </p>",danawilson001,false,1,0
