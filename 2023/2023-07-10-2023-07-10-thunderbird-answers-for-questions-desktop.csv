I have been using the beta with the new view and I now prefer it. On your question, the answer is no. Maintaining two interfaces would not support the future direction.

Please tell me what you mean by ""pieces you saved"", as I am unsure about what this may mean. The backup I do does a complete copy of everything in my default.release folder, and subsequent copies update all files in the target (copy) folder that have changed since the previous week. My understanding of Thunderbird is not great but I have used it for many years (I am 73) so have some awareness of the file structure, but this is not by any  means comprehensive. My understanding of your reply suggests (I think) that I should re-install Thunderbird and create a  new profile along with that, then copy into this the data elements (sqlite tables?) from my original profile. If I have this right then I could see this being a solution, but I do not know the full list of elements to be copied. Is there a definitive list of these held anywhere in the support base? </p>",mike.rampling,false,0,0
