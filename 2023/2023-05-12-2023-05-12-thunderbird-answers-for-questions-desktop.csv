As you originally had a POP account it would have stored all your emails automatically on your computer in mbox files and it was not necessary to remove it.

There is also no mbox file of same name which is odd. </p><p>Instead the 'ChickasawDust' folder has a load of files which looks like yet another pop account of unknown name. But it's a bit odd because it has some files normally only associated with an imap account or in your case an exchange account. </p><p>Then you also have Desktop &gt; eMail and also same location 'ChickasawDust' It's basically the same mess. Various folders and files of various accounts all lumped into each other and no way of knowing what server any of them relate to. </p><p>But regardless the only files that have any emails are all those that are called 'Inbox' (no extension). Anything with a .msf extension is only an index file used by Thunderbird, it does not contain any emails. </p><p><strong>re: I then copied the files back to the email folders.  They were there but very soon they were removed.</strong> You are using owl for exchange, so you are hooked up to the exchange server, and you cannot put back pop account files because they do not exist on server - they would get deleted. </p><p><strong>re The old folder inside Thunderbird are all gone and replace with Archive, Bulk Mail, Conversation History, Email_Templates, Send_Later. </strong> They are gone because they do not exist on server.

This was the incoming “<a href=""http://pop.secureserver.net"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.secureserver.net</a>” of the old email.  The outgoing was “<a href=""http://smtpout.secureserver.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtpout.secureserver.net</a>”. I assume that mean it is POP server.  When provider change to Microsoft 365 over night my email quit working. I called and they made changes so I could keep using my email. Later they sent (caned) email saying I needed to make changes so I could get my email.  I though that I didn’t need to because I already talked to them.  After doing searches on Thunderbird support, I backed up my email (I hope), and removed one account. Then I added it back and it download “Owl for Exchange” and finished up.  At first it looked good so I did the rest of my accounts.  Later I discovered the problems.  I then copied the files back to the email folders.  They were there but very soon they were removed.  I still have the backups. When I right click on any of the items in the Folder Pane there is no option to Subscribe nor Refresh. I did not remove the Gmail account. I’m not sure but seems most of the Gmail maybe all are on the web, but the local Gmail is all gone. In the past all my email was in Thunderbird till I deleted them.  I move them into folders in Thunderbird and they were there till changes were made.  The old folder inside Thunderbird are all gone and replace with Archive, Bulk Mail, Conversation History, Email_Templates, Send_Later.  I think I did have Archive folder, but not sure.

My guess is it's either the new line character or a paragraph mark. Many text editors can convert those to spaces. I suggest trying a text editor, such as the free notepad++ or whatever other you prefer. For example, Notepad++ has a simple Edit&gt;blank operations&gt;EOL to space that does it quickly.  You may still have to find paragraph breaks, but this might help. Anyway, I've used this process before, so I offer for your possible use. Good luck. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
