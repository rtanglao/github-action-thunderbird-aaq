However I have noticed that due to the new unified toolbar a lot of vertical space is lost if using multiple tabs. Since I have a small display vertical space is quite precious to me. So I was wondering if there is a way to either disable the unified toolbar (not preferred) or move the tabs into the unified toolbar (preferred)? And potentially even reduce the height of the unified toolbar beyond the compact option? </p><p>I assume it will have to be a modification via userChrome.css, but while I can maintain once I don't have the required knowledge to create my own. </p><p>Attached is a short comparison picture between 115 (left) and my current setup(right) </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",jonathan.schaefer

1418138,2023-07-12 05:09:48 -0700,2023-07-12 05:09:48 -0700,Thunderbird is empty,"<p>A few weeks ago I started a project to transfer emails from a webmail service (a POP3 account) to local storage on my PC, using TB to move the emails and to be the 'container'.  A trial download of around 90 emails appeared to be successful and the messages were moved into a number of TB local folders.  Daily life then overtook the project. Now resuming, it's a bit of a shock to find TB almost completely empty:  no emails, no folders, and no account for the webmail, no accounts at all.  (The only thing there was a handful of collected addresses from a failed attempt some years ago to set TB up as an active client for a different webmail service.)  I thought I exited TB after the trial download before manually deleting the messages on the webmail server but maybe I didn't — if this is significant.  And I don't know what the TB settings for the webmail account were, which it set up automatically, as the account has now vanished.  I should have checked at the time, I realise. Not much to go on but can anyone surmise what happened, what I did wrong? Should I assume that the emails are lost for good?  I did not take a specific TB back up.  There is nothing in the TB profile.  File History was on an hourly schedule at the time but I am unclear what exactly it backs up, or how, and I can't see anything relevant there.  And comments in the forum suggest you can't restore successfully from there anyway. And I'd be very grateful for any advice on how to do this properly so that the emails, etc.,  do not evaporate.
