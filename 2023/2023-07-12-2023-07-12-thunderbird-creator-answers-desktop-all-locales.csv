When I tried setting it up with my ISP server, I tried IMAP, but it wouldn't let me log in, saying invalid password, using the same password I have been using since Abraham. I then realized what I really wanted was POP, so I could store my emails on my computer. So, I tried that but got the same results. I've not had this problem with other new computers I have bought. It has always been seamless. So, what do I need to do to get past this? Thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1590045;,Cris47
