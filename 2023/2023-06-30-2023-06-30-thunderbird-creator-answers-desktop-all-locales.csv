I want to import all my emails and folders that contain emails, in the same order to my Thunderbird 102. I've already purchased the SysTools PST Convertor program and entered in a fresh PST file that included all my email folders, emails within, contacts, calendars, etc.  I then loaded that PST file to the SysTools PST Convertor and created MBOX files (yes, plural as it created a different MBOX file for each folder I had). </p><p>Now I don't know how to import that to Thunderbird as each time I use the import feature and choose ""Outlook"", it replies with ""PROFILE NOT FOUND"". </p><p>I have no idea how to proceed since I tried to enter these MBOX files (as created by the convertor) into the Local Folders of my Thunderbird profile but just got the folders.  Nothing was inside the folders after I restarted Thunderbird. Any suggestions here??  Can't find anything online about this. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",timwillms
