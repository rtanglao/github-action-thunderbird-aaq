After that i accidentally ignored message that I received. After this I tried to un-ignore said message, but I couldn't find any way to do it. I tried ignoring and un-ignoring whole thread, but it did nothing. </p><p>I finally succeeded by copying whole thread to separate folder where said message was no longer ignored and copied single message back to where I wanted it to be. This is only partial success, as I have now thread with three messages - my original message, an answer that I received, and copy of that message that is ignored. </p><p>Is there any way to do it not in the roundabout way? </p><p>Thanks in advance, JD </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jedrzej.dudkiewicz

Then I noted that the text was formatted differently, so I wanted to undo the change and re-paste the text as ""paste without formatting"".  As soon as I press on undo, the pasted text disappears with the entire paragraph where it was pasted and I cannot redo/undo the lost text anymore. This is very annoying!  </p><p>I am using Thunderbird since years and did not observe this behavior before - so either it is related with recent versions or there is interference with some other settings/antivirus or other reasons in my computer that I am unaware of. Can someone reproduce this behavior and propose some way to restore the lost text? Or if it is a bug, can it be removed it in the next version? My Mozilla version: 102.12.0 (64-bit). </p><p>Best regards </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",vishap

I want to import all my emails and folders that contain emails, in the same order to my Thunderbird 102. I've already purchased the SysTools PST Convertor program and entered in a fresh PST file that included all my email folders, emails within, contacts, calendars, etc.  I then loaded that PST file to the SysTools PST Convertor and created MBOX files (yes, plural as it created a different MBOX file for each folder I had). </p><p>Now I don't know how to import that to Thunderbird as each time I use the import feature and choose ""Outlook"", it replies with ""PROFILE NOT FOUND"". </p><p>I have no idea how to proceed since I tried to enter these MBOX files (as created by the convertor) into the Local Folders of my Thunderbird profile but just got the folders.  Nothing was inside the folders after I restarted Thunderbird. Any suggestions here??
