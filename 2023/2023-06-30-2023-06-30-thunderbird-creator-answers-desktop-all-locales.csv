1417188,2023-06-30 14:24:52 -0700,2023-06-30 14:24:52 -0700,Email Passwords,"<p>In trying to troubleshoot and resolve a problem sending and receiving email from my ISP and their domain name in the email addresses, I've tried to exonerate or blame either Thunderbird or their email system.  To date I've been unsuccessful.  I'm here now to ask some questions that might move the issue forward to identify the problem and resolve it. </p><p>It is my understanding that Thunderbird stores passwords I have assigned to accounts.  Because there are (or appear not to be) means to simply enter those passwords within Thunderbird, there must be another way that TB acquires them.  From having used TB for years, I've observed that TB serves a response that asks for a password when authentication between the TB client software and an ISP mail serve.  I have inferred that it is this pathway that allows TB to acquire passwords that it then stores when they have been used successfully validated.   </p><p>Does email account password acquisition by Thunderbird function in the way I described (or close to it, even)?  If that is not how it is done, how is it done?  IOW, How do I tell Thunderbird what passwords to use to validate email message exchanges with my ISP? </p><p>This question arises from my attempts to resolve my problem, but leads to questions about how I decided I would resolve the issue of unrecognized passwords.  My plan was to delete passwords for these email accounts from Thunderbird and from my ISP and start fresh with new passwords.  To that end, I learned how to find the passwords that TB stores buy following Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy and Security &gt; Saved Passwords &gt; Show Passwords.  I then captured that information in a separate text file so that I would not lose those passwords and deleted all the passwords in Thunderbird. </p><p>I ran into problems with my ISP in trying to delete and set up new passwords.  I'm trying to make them own the problem and they are saying that the problem is in TB therefore beyond their responsibility.  What's worse is that they are using the email password validation problem to refuse ownership of their email address password interface problem.  That's why I'm back here asking questions . . .   to exonerate Thunderbird or learn what I don't know. </p><p>Thank you for any assistance you can give to help me understand how TB acquires and uses email account passwords. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",rabbithutch1
