The server name already exists.  This is in my experience generally an occurrence when people try to fix something that they do not like by adding the account a second or subsequent time.  Just because you can not see your account in the folder pane does not mean it is not configured. Especially if there is any sort of update needed to owl following a Thunderbird or outlook update.   </p><p>The first port of call when using OWL and you see an issue with an OWL managed account is to look at the download site to ensure you have the latest version. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/owl-for-exchange/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/owl-for-exchange/</a> </p><p>The Thunderbird add-on manager will often download an update because checking for update is one of it's functions, but it can not always install it without a restart of Thunderbird.  So check the add-on manager that it is not awaiting a restart to install an update. </p><p>I then suggest you go to the more troubleshooting information on the help menu and look in the Mail and New Accounts section to see what account are configured.   </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-06-17-00-10-08-6d1303.png""></p><p>I have included a small image of my info so you know what you are looking for.  Extra points if you copy and paste your account information into the forum as a reply so someone like myself of David can see what accounts you have configured, instead of guessing. </p><p>If your account is still configured and is otherwise causing some issue,  then the next step should be to contact the OWL support folks to see if they are aware of a similar problem. Historically they have been quite fast to reply to support requests, as well as getting update out if they are required. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
