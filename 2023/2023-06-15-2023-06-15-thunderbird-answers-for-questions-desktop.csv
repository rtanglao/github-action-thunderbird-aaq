It is not a bug or virus on your computer. </p><p>Your Thunderbird is not accessing server, so no password is going to be asked. <strong>1.</strong> Are you using Thunderbird in OFFLINE mode  </p> <ul><li> check the bottom left corner of status bar to see if you are in ONLINE or OFFLINE mode and make sure you are in ONLINE mode. </li></ul> <p><strong>2. </strong>Are you using the correct server settings  post information on what settings you are currently using to access the server. </p> <ul><li> Help &gt; More TRoubleshooting Information </li><li> scroll to 'Mail and News  Accounts' section </li><li> Post an image showing all the data in that section. </li></ul> <p><strong>3. </strong>Does server support the TLS versions used by Thunderbird? </p> <ul><li> Settings &gt; General </li><li> Scroll to bottom and click on 'Config Editor' </li><li> In search type: tls.version </li><li> look for <strong>security.tls.version.min</strong> </li><li> by default it is number 3 - you could try number 2 and then restart Thunderbird. </li></ul> <p>However, you would expect this to be ok because all was working prior to bad password.

I've just had a similar discussion with another person who was not getting a password prompt and after several checks they realised they had not properly switched off all Firewalls. It then worked so they decided to follow advise and get Thunderbird set up as an allowed program and only have one Firewall in operation. </p><p>You should have only one Firewall working on computer. If you have installed various Anti-virus then one of them may be controlling the Firewall. eg: If you use McAFee and it controls Firewall and you switch it off then the default Windows Defender may  auto switch on.  So you will still have a Firewall operating. It's also possible you have domain, public and private selections in the Firewall and you may have only switched off one of them.  So it's possible to think you have switched off Firewall, but may still have one operating. </p><p>Please make sure you have done this and it must be done for whatever program is controlling the firewall. Exit Thunderbird, access Firewall and set up thunderbird.exe as an allowed program and if using Windows Defender set it up to allow using PUBLIC. Then restart Thunderbird. </p><p>Can you please confirm - any program running Firewall has Thunderbird.exe set up as an allowed program . Please post images showing this.

Right-click on the shortcut on the desktop you just created and Select <strong>Properties</strong> Find the <strong>Target:</strong> field  and Add a <strong> -P</strong>  at the very end.

With this, you can actually open two profiles at once.

At the same time I was able to import and sort ALL my old Addresses in the Address books. There are a FEW address books from over the years (various versions like v2, v3, etc...).   I feel it was worth it. I still have access to my OLD stuff, but rarely need to go there.

I recently had someone who lived locally to me, who could easily use his browser to connect to webmail but could not use Thunderbird.

As soon as I had got him back onto his own network connecting to his isp, thunderbird was up and running again. </p><p>Please double check to see if your computer is using the correct network.  Your Firewall would not permit Thunderbird to use what it regards as a 'public' connection. Password is not asked because the server did not ask for it.

The server name already exists.  This is in my experience generally an occurrence when people try to fix something that they do not like by adding the account a second or subsequent time.  Just because you can not see your account in the folder pane does not mean it is not configured. Especially if there is any sort of update needed to owl following a Thunderbird or outlook update.   </p><p>The first port of call when using OWL and you see an issue with an OWL managed account is to look at the download site to ensure you have the latest version. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/owl-for-exchange/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/owl-for-exchange/</a> </p><p>The Thunderbird add-on manager will often download an update because checking for update is one of it's functions, but it can not always install it without a restart of Thunderbird.  So check the add-on manager that it is not awaiting a restart to install an update. </p><p>I then suggest you go to the more troubleshooting information on the help menu and look in the Mail and New Accounts section to see what account are configured.   </p><p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-06-17-00-10-08-6d1303.png""></p><p>I have included a small image of my info so you know what you are looking for.  Extra points if you copy and paste your account information into the forum as a reply so someone like myself of David can see what accounts you have configured, instead of guessing. </p><p>If your account is still configured and is otherwise causing some issue,  then the next step should be to contact the OWL support folks to see if they are aware of a similar problem. Historically they have been quite fast to reply to support requests, as well as getting update out if they are required. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
