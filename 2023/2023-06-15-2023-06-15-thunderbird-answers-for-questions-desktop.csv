I looked in my profile and I do notice that the Trash file under Local Folders grew from 0KB to 20KB.  While the Trash files located in my email account folders remains at 0KB.  There is also a folder for smart mailboxes in my profile but not sure what that is honestly.  This leads me to believe they could be going to the Local Folder but I do not know how to change this and allow me to see them in the Trash icon in Thunderbird.  I have searched all around the settings and account settings but I just do not see an answer.  Really appreciate additional guidance.  Thanks! </p>,rino1222,false,0,0
