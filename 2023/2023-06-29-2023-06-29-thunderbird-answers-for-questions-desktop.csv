Gmail realise that this is not exactly very userfriendly, so they created 'labels' which means they offer a view which looks like folders.  When a 'label' is applied to the email in the 'All Mail' folder, it gets displayed in whatever the label is called. When a new email arrives on the gmail server, it will auto get the 'Inbox' label.  Depending upon whatever settings you have set up in the webmail account, it may also get another label eg: 'Important'. The application of 'labels' means the one sinle email in the 'All Mail' folder can be seen in more than one label/folder. They are not separate copies of that email, just a virtual view of email in various folders/labels. When you delete an email you need the email to go to the gmail Trash folder/label which is sometimes also called 'Bin'. Gmail will then realise you want to delete the email from the 'All Mail' folder, so all labels get removed and email cannot be seen in any folder and after 30 days gmail will auto remove that deleted email from the 'Trash' and it's gone. </p><p>In Thunderbird, you need to use an imap account in order to see all the same 'labels/folders' as shown on the server.  In Thunderbird those gmail 'labels' are separate files, they are displayed as folders. All default server folders will be auto subscribed to be seen. </p><p>You must set up Thunderbird to do the following. When you delete email - put email in the gmail default 'Trash' folder. Check this now and confirm you have this set up properly. </p> <ul><li> In Account Settings </li><li> Select 'Server Settings' for the gmail account </li><li> When I delete a message: </li><li> Select&nbsp;: 'Move it to this folder' and select 'Trash on gmail account/email address' </li></ul> <p>If you make any changes to this setting please check to see if deleting now works ok. Post an image showing this setting so we can see what you are using. </p><p>Then when you click on 'Delete' email should get put into the gmail 'Trash' folder. </p><p>However, there may be occasions when you want to delete the email from one folder but not all folders eg: delete from Inbox but keep the same one displayed in 'Important'. OR delete the email from the imap account Inbox but keep it stored on server in 'All Mail'. This process means you really need to instruct gmail to just remove a 'label' not actually delete completely. In Thunderbird, you need to use a different delete method, one that bypasses the gmail Trash. Using keyboard - Hold down 'Shift' and click on the 'Del' key. Note there is no 'Undo' action available for this. But it does mean email is still in 'All Mail' folder, so you could access gmail webmail account and get a label re-applied for whatever folder you want. </p><p>You say <em>when you delete an email, it reappears in four different places.</em> There are two things here to clarify: <strong>1</strong>. <strong>What method are you using to delete&nbsp;?</strong> Are you right clicking on email and selecting delete message&nbsp;? Are you reading email in Message Pane and clicking on 'Delete' button&nbsp;? Do you have the 'Delete' column header enabled - select email and click on the bin icon in column&nbsp;? There are other methods - what method are you using? </p><p>'<em>2. '</em><strong>What four different places are you talking about?</strong> If you see the 'All Mail' folder in folder Pane then I'll advise you to unsubscribe from seeing it because it is just a complete copy of absolutely everything you are already seeing in all other folders.  In Folder Pane </p> <ul><li> right click on the gmail account name and select 'Subscribe' </li><li> Select the 'All Mail' folder and click on 'Unsubscribe' </li><li> Click on 'OK' </li></ul> <p>Please tell us what other places the deleted email appears. </p><p>Suggest you post an image of the Folder Pane so we can see all the list of folders. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
