My instructions to copy profile to another drive and then change settings for account in thunderbird are  a quick and easy way to move profile, BUT, that still leaves the original profile pointing to accounts in the new profile. SO.... when you deleted the old profile, the pointers to the new profile died. To fully remove profile from drive C, you need to use profile manager.

Sorry to take a week to say so. </p><p>2)  Matt, when  I said ""obscure"", I didn't mean it was hard to get to.  Rather, I meant that for a new user - myself, at least - I don't think of an email account as a file, so I wouldn't expect it to be under File / New.  It's a combination of the location and the labeling that makes it obscure. </p><p>3)  I followed the instructions in David's 6/30/23, 5:10 AM post before seeing Matt's 6/30/23, 6:20 PM post.  Here's where that's at. </p><p>a)  I added all my accounts successfully.  The data went into C:\Users\Keith\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\ </p><p>b)  With TB closed, I copied the Thunderbird folder to K:\AppData\Thunderbird\ </p><p>(The folder copied easily, except for one .js file.  However, I was able to copy that file too in Windows Safe mode.) </p><p>c)  With TB open, I changed the profile location of each account in that account's server settings. </p><p>d)  On that basis, when I ""get messages"" for each account, files change in the K drive location, not the C drive location, meaning that TB is utilizing the K drive location for the account.  Good. </p><p>e)  HOWEVER, when I close TB then remove the Thunderbird folder from C:\Users\Keith\AppData\Roaming\ and then reopen TB, it opens with no accounts.  This means that even though the information *FOR* each account is in K drive, and *SOME PART* of TB knows to use K drive for the account, *THAT PART* of TB - that is, *THE PART WHICH TELLS TB TO USE K DRIVE* - is itself on C drive, somewhere in C:\Users\Keith\AppData\Roaming\ </p><p>f)  Then I wanted to tell TB to look on K drive - in K:\AppData\Thunderbird\ - for the information about the accounts (and everything else TB needs to know, besides what's in C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird), so I can delete the Thunderbird directory in C:\Users\Keith\AppData\Roaming\  </p><p>(That's really optional, since at least I've got TB dumping my messages into K drive, which has room for them, instead of my cramped  C drive, but I'd like to get rid of a directory that's (almost) only clutter.) </p><p>g)  At this point, after doing all the above, I finally saw Matt's 6/30/23, 6:20 PM post.  And with this page ... </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles</a> </p><p>I managed to get to Help / Troubleshooting Information / Profiles / about:profiles </p><p>(Actually, on my TB 102.12.0 64-bit, it's ""More Troubleshooting Information"" rather than ""Troubleshooting Information"".)  </p><p>h)  That page (see attached image) shows two profiles.  The first says ""This is the profile in use and it cannot be deleted."" </p><p>So on the second profile, I clicked on Open Folder.  I figured I would navigate to the location of K-drive copy of the first profile.  However, when I got there, I found that I couldn't save the new location.  There's no Save button. </p><p>i)  So Then I figured I would create a new profile and make it the default, as per Matt's suggestion.  But when I opened the Create Profile Wizard, it said (again, see attached image), ""Your user settings, preferences and other user related date will be stored in:"" and then showed the C drive location. </p><p>I suppose I can still follow through on my intention in ""i"", which might immunize me to the problem Matt pointed out with David's suggestion, but it seems i still can't wipe out the Thunderbird folder on C drive. </p><p>Stymied again! </p><p>Your comments, suggestions and warnings at this point, gentlemen? </p><p>Thanks again to you both! </p><p>Keith </p>",firefox2367,false,0,0

I have dealt with lots of support issues over the years where folk are lost moving their profile to a new device because of such a change and have forgotten it.

Gmail realise that this is not exactly very userfriendly, so they created 'labels' which means they offer a view which looks like folders.  When a 'label' is applied to the email in the 'All Mail' folder, it gets displayed in whatever the label is called. When a new email arrives on the gmail server, it will auto get the 'Inbox' label.  Depending upon whatever settings you have set up in the webmail account, it may also get another label eg: 'Important'. The application of 'labels' means the one sinle email in the 'All Mail' folder can be seen in more than one label/folder. They are not separate copies of that email, just a virtual view of email in various folders/labels. When you delete an email you need the email to go to the gmail Trash folder/label which is sometimes also called 'Bin'. Gmail will then realise you want to delete the email from the 'All Mail' folder, so all labels get removed and email cannot be seen in any folder and after 30 days gmail will auto remove that deleted email from the 'Trash' and it's gone. </p><p>In Thunderbird, you need to use an imap account in order to see all the same 'labels/folders' as shown on the server.  In Thunderbird those gmail 'labels' are separate files, they are displayed as folders. All default server folders will be auto subscribed to be seen. </p><p>You must set up Thunderbird to do the following. When you delete email - put email in the gmail default 'Trash' folder. Check this now and confirm you have this set up properly. </p> <ul><li> In Account Settings </li><li> Select 'Server Settings' for the gmail account </li><li> When I delete a message: </li><li> Select&nbsp;: 'Move it to this folder' and select 'Trash on gmail account/email address' </li></ul> <p>If you make any changes to this setting please check to see if deleting now works ok. Post an image showing this setting so we can see what you are using. </p><p>Then when you click on 'Delete' email should get put into the gmail 'Trash' folder. </p><p>However, there may be occasions when you want to delete the email from one folder but not all folders eg: delete from Inbox but keep the same one displayed in 'Important'. OR delete the email from the imap account Inbox but keep it stored on server in 'All Mail'. This process means you really need to instruct gmail to just remove a 'label' not actually delete completely. In Thunderbird, you need to use a different delete method, one that bypasses the gmail Trash. Using keyboard - Hold down 'Shift' and click on the 'Del' key. Note there is no 'Undo' action available for this. But it does mean email is still in 'All Mail' folder, so you could access gmail webmail account and get a label re-applied for whatever folder you want. </p><p>You say <em>when you delete an email, it reappears in four different places.</em> There are two things here to clarify: <strong>1</strong>. <strong>What method are you using to delete&nbsp;?</strong> Are you right clicking on email and selecting delete message&nbsp;? Are you reading email in Message Pane and clicking on 'Delete' button&nbsp;? Do you have the 'Delete' column header enabled - select email and click on the bin icon in column&nbsp;? There are other methods - what method are you using? </p><p>'<em>2. '</em><strong>What four different places are you talking about?</strong> If you see the 'All Mail' folder in folder Pane then I'll advise you to unsubscribe from seeing it because it is just a complete copy of absolutely everything you are already seeing in all other folders.  In Folder Pane </p> <ul><li> right click on the gmail account name and select 'Subscribe' </li><li> Select the 'All Mail' folder and click on 'Unsubscribe' </li><li> Click on 'OK' </li></ul> <p>Please tell us what other places the deleted email appears. </p><p>Suggest you post an image of the Folder Pane so we can see all the list of folders. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
