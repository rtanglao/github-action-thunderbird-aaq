Braxmail, which goes along with it, is an even more impregnable provider than Protonmail or its equivalents. It is an Android phone, and unfortunately where I live it is not compatible with the only reliable provider in my area. So it just wasn't suitable for me. But I loved the Thunderbird program which Braxmail is compatible with. But I can;t get Apple Mail on the Brax phone, and I can't get Braxmail on my iPhone! So I thought if I installed Thunderbird to use with Apple Mail, it would make it easier to transfer the data I have on the Braxmail program (It is supported on my MacBook Pro.).
