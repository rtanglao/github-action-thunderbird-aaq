Within the past few days, Microsoft made some changes to Outlook Live, and it is preventing me from seeing new e-mails in my Hotmail account (among other defects). So I want to try accessing Hotmail through Thunderbird, which I believe is possible (correct me if I’m wrong). But I’m afraid of screwing up my stable Thunderbird configuration and introducing problems in accessing my Gmail account. Is there a way to save the current configuration, and then revert back to it if I do indeed mess things up when trying to add Hotmail? (By the way, I do have access to those Hotmail e-mails on my phone and tablet, where I use Bluemail.) </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1574114;,gf1701
