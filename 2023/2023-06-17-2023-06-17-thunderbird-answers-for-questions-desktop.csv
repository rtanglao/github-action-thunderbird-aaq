My mail retention is set to delete after 14 days.  popstate.dat is about 10KB so I guess that just refers to the last 14 days' emails.  So I think I will be fine to delete then, and just live with about ten days of duplicate emails downloaded to my Inbox (by the sounds of things).  Thank you for your help. </p><p>(Afraid to say, the 7GB is legit and compacted.  It's all my emails since September 2003, hence why I don't want to lose them.  Thunderbird is quite happy with this.) </p><p>Edit to add: deleted the file, Thunderbird came alive and downloaded all the mails again, with duplicates of the first 11 days as expected, but that's not really a problem.

If your setting is delete from server it will normally be empty. </p><p>The upshot of deleting it is anything remaining on the server will be downloaded again.  Before you delete it,  open it in windows notepad, select save as and ensure the utf-8 encoding is selected and replace the existing file (with Thunderbird closed obviously).  It might not work if the file content is corrupt,  but it might. </p><p>If you have not compacted the inbox recently you might want to try doing so.  Surely you do not have 7Gb of mail in a single folder as the file size indicates.  I would be more expecting a long term failure to compact,  so every mail you have ever moved or deleted is still stored in the file (Compacting is what removes the data from those mails from the file.) </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

That seems to indicate the problem: ""NotReadableError: Could not read file(......\popstate.dat) because it is not UTF-8 encoded"" (path elided by me, but refers to that account).  I had a brief look at the file but it seems to be binary encoded, not plain text, which makes the error a bit confusing.

It could be a strict as to not deliver to the inbox unless your address is in the recipients address book. </p><p>There are many degrees between everything gets through to only those in the address book get through.  Historically the most common stumbling block are email signatures,  especially if you can send in web mail and get it delivered but not in Thunderbird.  The issues with signatures are usually related to images for social media web sites as they have previously been used by spammers.  But just the existence of a signature can be enough. </p><p>Then we have folks that are sending using their ISP server and an email address for another domain.  This is a key indicator of SPAM.  For instance sending for George@gmail.com using a outgoing mail server for Comcast, instead of the Gmail one. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
