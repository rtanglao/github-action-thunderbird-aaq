It could be a strict as to not deliver to the inbox unless your address is in the recipients address book. </p><p>There are many degrees between everything gets through to only those in the address book get through.  Historically the most common stumbling block are email signatures,  especially if you can send in web mail and get it delivered but not in Thunderbird.  The issues with signatures are usually related to images for social media web sites as they have previously been used by spammers.  But just the existence of a signature can be enough. </p><p>Then we have folks that are sending using their ISP server and an email address for another domain.  This is a key indicator of SPAM.  For instance sending for George@gmail.com using a outgoing mail server for Comcast, instead of the Gmail one. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
