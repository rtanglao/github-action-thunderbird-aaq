But i will go back to my original question...  Why cannot I put a button on my toolbar for ""Select All?"" </blockquote> <p>I would guess because one does not exist! That is essentially what you have been told in this thread and your last.  Have you formally requested such a thing? <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org</a> or even made a suggestion about it in the feedback forum? <a href=""https://connect.mozilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://connect.mozilla.org/</a> If not I suggest you do. </p> <blockquote> There used to be a most helpful add-in, but the numerous API changes kills that option. </blockquote> <p>And that part of the discussion was detailed in your earlier topic.  Nothing with regard to historical API changes is going to change.  Add-ons are not supported on this forum as they are supported by their authors.  Clearly the author of your add-on ceased updating it.  Fundamentally it is no longer available.  That is ALL we can report to you. </p> <blockquote>  But really, is this thread really going to make me go through all the use-case justifications that I have posted here in the past? </blockquote> <p>Nope,  actually to request features is off topic in the support forum,  and you should have been pointed to the correct ways to request change rather than allowed to continue here.  There is nothing anyone in a peer user support forum such as this can do that you can not do yourself.  </p> <blockquote> All I have asked for was a simple replacement for the Select All plug-in. </blockquote> <p>And such a thing does not exist.  No amount of discussing or lamenting will change that.  I have given you the appropriate venues to request change.  This is not one of them. Sorry. </p> <blockquote> If that is (as it seems to be) beyond the capabilities of the current developers, why not say so, and we are can just move on. </blockquote> <p>As no one has asked them (the developers) it is rather difficult to determine what is possible.  I would think it would be fairly simple,  but just because I think that does not mean anyone of the paid developers will actually implement it.  First it will need to be requested. </p>  <blockquote> But all I see here is deflection and non-solutions.  Why? </blockquote> <p>You are asking in the wrong place of the wrong people might be a large part of your issue with getting what you think is acceptable service. You want the product changed to to include a button that has never been in the core product. This is simply the wrong place to request such a thing.   This is user support where folk try and explain how to do what you want without the button. The addon developer has seen fit to not release a version of that button in recent years. (It might not even be possible.  I am not an addon developer.) so from a support perspective the only option is a workaround. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
