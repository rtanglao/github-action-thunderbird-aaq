However, since you can log in to the web account, you might set it to forward all mail to your employee account and create an 'identity' on that account for the info@ account.

The email account is something you've set up, such as with Gmail, Outlook, or whatever. Possibly sharing the text to the right of the @ sign in your email account may provide that information. In summary, switching to a different client requires awareness of the current client's connection information. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

That is, there is not yet (to my knowledge) a seamless ability to synchronize email addresses across multiple devices (although I acknowledge that there are proprietary approaches that claim to be close to a full solution). Google's contact list works rather well, but does require some setup on the PC. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
