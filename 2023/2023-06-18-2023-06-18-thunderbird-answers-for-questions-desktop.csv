That is, there is not yet (to my knowledge) a seamless ability to synchronize email addresses across multiple devices (although I acknowledge that there are proprietary approaches that claim to be close to a full solution). Google's contact list works rather well, but does require some setup on the PC. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
