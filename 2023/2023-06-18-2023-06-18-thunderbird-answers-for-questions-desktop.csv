On the addressbook, look for a file whose name begins with 'abook' - you can import with TB, or copy into profile when TB is not running. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

My email account is <a href=""http://verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">verizon.net</a>.

On my old computer I have a ton of old emails stored in my Windows Live Mail THAT ARE NO LONGER IN MY <a href=""http://verizon.net/AOL"" rel=""nofollow"">verizon.net/AOL</a> account.  Those old emails are in various folders and subfolders in WLM on my old computer.  I want to move those old emails into the Thunderbird I set up on my new computer. </p><p>Please let me know if you understand my request.  Thanks. </p>",cvancant,false,0,0

The email account is something you've set up, such as with Gmail, Outlook, or whatever. Possibly sharing the text to the right of the @ sign in your email account may provide that information. In summary, switching to a different client requires awareness of the current client's connection information. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

That is, there is not yet (to my knowledge) a seamless ability to synchronize email addresses across multiple devices (although I acknowledge that there are proprietary approaches that claim to be close to a full solution). Google's contact list works rather well, but does require some setup on the PC. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
