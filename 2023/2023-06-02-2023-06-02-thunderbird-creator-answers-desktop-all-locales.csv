I am using Thunderbird on LinuxMint (latest). When importing an event from an .ics file (sent from an organization, business, etc), the time is exactly the numbers on the event and not translated to my local time. For example, if the event is at 10:00 am in Chicago and I am in Boston, then it should say that the event is at 11:00 am. Instead, it says 10:00 am for Boston (and now I am an hour early). </p><p>For sometime now, I have been editing the event manually. I have rummaged through the calendar settings and the timezone is set correctly. Is there a setting that could be added or a custom coding to help with this issue? </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",studio49
