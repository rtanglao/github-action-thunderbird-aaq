My email account (on my server) is IMAP but my Thunderbird account is setup as POP so that's probably why I don't see any sync options in my account settings.  So what I'm trying now is setting up Tbird on another computer and I'm downloading my server emails now. Once they are downloaded, I'm going to grab the emails I need and move them to a new local folder then copy that local folder to my main computer and put that folder into my ""local folders"" for Tbird, then move the files I need into my inbox.  Hopefully that will solve the problem for now, then I can back up my inbox and have all my current emails up to date. - Then, I'll look into switching my Tbird account over to IMAP from POP - looks like I need to create the new IMAP account and disable the POP account. </p>",jon107,false,0,0

Yes, the emails I lost are on my IMAP server but they are not in my Inbox folder in Tbird.  I want to get those lost emails from my server, back into my Tbird inbox and sorted by date properly but Tbird already retrieved them once and setting my emails on my server to ""unread"" does not fool Tbird into retrieving them again. This is what I need to do.  I need to tell Tbird to retrieve email files back from a certain date as to populate my inbox folder with the lost emails. When I click offline download, what am I downloading? Files from my server? If so, can I then merge or move them into my inbox folder that's on my hard drive? </p>",jon107,false,0,0
