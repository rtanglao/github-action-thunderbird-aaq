Are you sure your account is IMAP? I ask that because all messages are always viewable online with an IMAP account, but your words imply that there are no messages. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Yes, the emails I lost are on my IMAP server but they are not in my Inbox folder in Tbird.  I want to get those lost emails from my server, back into my Tbird inbox and sorted by date properly but Tbird already retrieved them once and setting my emails on my server to ""unread"" does not fool Tbird into retrieving them again. This is what I need to do.  I need to tell Tbird to retrieve email files back from a certain date as to populate my inbox folder with the lost emails. When I click offline download, what am I downloading? Files from my server? If so, can I then merge or move them into my inbox folder that's on my hard drive? </p>",jon107,false,0,0
