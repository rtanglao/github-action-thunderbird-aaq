Now for certain email addresses I am unable to send encrypted email.  Thunderbird says:  ""Sending of the message failed. You specified encryption for this message, but the application failed to find an encryption certificate for xxx@xxx.xxx""   However, I can see via the Account Settings and People certs that  those Certs exists and are valid.  Also, via command line reading the cert9.db and key4.db, the Cert for those users exist: </p><p>Certificate: </p><pre>   Data:        Version: 3 (0x2)        Serial Number: 363175 (0x58aa7)        Signature Algorithm: PKCS #1 SHA-256 With RSA Encryption        Issuer: ""CN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXC=US""        Validity:            Not Before: Thu Jul 07 00:00:00 2022            Not After&nbsp;: Sun Jul 06 23:59:59 2025        Subject: ""CN=XXX@XXX.XXX - OU=XXX, OU=XXX, O=XXX </pre> <p>Anyhow, I noticed that the cert8.db and key3.db had older entries, and I move that file to a backup folder so Thunderbird is only using cert9.db and key4.db.  Again, the cert exists and Thunderbird sees it with the GUI.   I didn't have this problem previously. I did obviously try keeping  the cert8.db and key3.db along with cert9.db and key4.db in the Thunderbird dir, but again, it appears Thunderbird has moved on to using cert9.db and key4db.  Some users with Valid Certs work for sending encrypted emails and some users do not. BTW: The intermediate signing and root signing certs are all trusted.  </p><p>Also, for this new Version, when I run the GUI Tool/Tab from Thunderbird -&gt; Security -&gt; View Certificates of Recipients the output shows Not found for any users, even for the users who I am able send an encrypted email to (like myself). I can send myself an encrypted email, but tool output shows as Status ""Not Found"" for even my own cert even though I can send an encrypted email and read the encrypted email to myself via Thunderbird. </p><p>Please advise. </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,1582314;,mishra771

When I checked with the support team of my computer(linux), I was told that the problem with the three accounts was probably the POP settings and that I would do better with IMAP settings.  I tried to reconfigure the settings, but only resulted in being able to receive emails, but not being able to send emails.  This is a disaster for me. When I changed the settings I could only change from the input POP to IMAP.  The outgoing settings were not available.  There used to be an SMTP window with all the outgoing settings for all the email accounts I have.  Where is this window?  I can't find it anywhere.  I wish the designers would think about the changes they make and their effect on non-tech people. </p><p>Any help will be gratefully received. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1582316;,bdjim

A mail sent to both me and my wife (separate mailboxes with the same provider) a couple of days ago never arrived in my Thunderbird inbox, even though it was successfully delivered - I can see it using a webmail client, and with another IMAP client on Android (Aquamail). My wife also uses Thunderbird, and it happily retrieved her copy of the message. I asked her to forward it to me but the forwarded message also failed to arrive in Thunderbird. Thinking it must be something on my computer (Linux, as is hers) I installed Evolution on the same machine. That happily retrieves the original message and all the forwarding attempts. </p><p>I can only assume there's something particular about this message that is causing Thunderbird to treat it (and all forwards containing it) somehow to be treated differently from others on my machine. I'm getting no visible errors or warnings, and the messages don't seem to be moved to another folder (spam, junk or whatever) as far as I can see. </p><p>Any suggestions how I can work out what's going on? It's disconcerting to know that some messages can simply not show up in Thunderbird and on other occasions I might be completely unaware of it.  </p><p>SteveR. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",codesmith

The email is in a folder structure which I would like to preserve. I would like to avoid having to recreate the folder structure by hand on the target; that would be very time consuming. I have been experimenting with a small nested set of folders before moving on to the real problem. </p><p>My first thought was to drag and drop the top level folder to local folders. First I checked that I could do it one folder at a time - no problem. If I try with a top level folder with sub-structure it only works if I specify that all sub folders are to be held locally. There is no way to mark a whole branch for local storage (that I have found), so that is a bit tedious running down the folder list ticking. So question 1: is there a better way. </p><p>Then I want to drag and drop from the local folders to the second account. For a single folder this works. For my small test folder with sub-structure it does not work. </p><p>It may be significant that the IMAP server for BOTH accounts (same server) does not support folders with both messages and sub-folders; the option ""Server supports folders that contain sub-folders and messages"" is therefore unticked for both accounts. I wonder if the information that a specific folder only contains sub-folders is lost in the move. </p><p>I then tried the ImportExportTools-ng plug-in. That suffered pretty much the same problem. I could export (same synchronise issue as above). I could import the result to Local Folders, but I could not import the same data to my target account.  </p><p>I would be grateful for any other ideas. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",steve538
