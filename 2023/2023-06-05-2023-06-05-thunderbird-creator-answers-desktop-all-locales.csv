Most were POP, so before upgrading, I changed them all to IMAP.  </p><p>I then installed the new version. This did not pick up my existing Thunderbird profile (which is on my D drive), so I imported my old profile from the D drive. This did not import the server settings, so I reconfigured them for each account. </p><p>For some reason, only a small minority of my old email messages seem to have been imported, the oldest going back as far as 2015. The vast majority are missing. </p><p>I received an email message a couple of days ago (via my new Thunderbirds installation), but it is no longer visible in the Inbox of the account that received it. If I search for the message, it shows up, but I cannot find or access the email itself. </p><p>Additional to these problems, I cannot view all my emails in a unified folder. I select the Unified Folders option from meatball menu, top left - Folder Modes, but nothing changes and when I re-enter the menu it is unchecked. Likewise, if I go - main menu/View/Folders/ and check Unified, it does nothing and does not remain checked. </p><p>I've read all the available documentation and watched the YouTube Folder Panes video, but found no solution. </p><p>I would be very grateful for any assistance you can offer. </p><p>Regards, David </p>",fix-problems;tbbetasn;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1584084;,online34

I have just switched to Thunderbird Beta v114 with the unified inbox folder for all my email accounts and cannot get the inbox to sort this way. I can have the newest emails at the top without the starred emails, but as soon as I put the starred emails at the top all the other emails are sorted in reverse, that is, oldest at the top. I can get the exact opposite of the arrangement I want by putting the starred emails at the foot and then the newest emails, so the oldest emails are at the top. I cannot find any way to reproduce the sort order I always used before moving to v.114. </p>",customize;tbbetasn;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1584019;,joe105
