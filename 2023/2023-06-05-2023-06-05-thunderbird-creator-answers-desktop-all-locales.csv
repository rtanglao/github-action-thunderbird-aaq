I have just switched to Thunderbird Beta v114 with the unified inbox folder for all my email accounts and cannot get the inbox to sort this way. I can have the newest emails at the top without the starred emails, but as soon as I put the starred emails at the top all the other emails are sorted in reverse, that is, oldest at the top. I can get the exact opposite of the arrangement I want by putting the starred emails at the foot and then the newest emails, so the oldest emails are at the top. I cannot find any way to reproduce the sort order I always used before moving to v.114. </p>",customize;tbbetasn;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",joe105
