I verified that entries contain a first name, last name, and one or more email addresses.  Yet when I try to address an email within Thunderbird WRITE dialog by entering a few letters in  the 'TO' field, all that shows up are email addresses that match....no names.  In other words, if I type 'John Jones', only email addresses that happen to have those letters appear; not the entry for John Jones that contains his email address. </p><p>Do I not have some setting set correctly, or is this a limitation that matching only occurs within the email address itself (which i hope is not the case). </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",AndyDS

I backed up a year's worth of emails in a ZIP file before deleting the old email (apparently I had to) and I have followed the instructions to import the old emails. The imported file appears in my 'local folders' section in Thunderbird but these files appear to be empty. I cannot find information or previous questions addressing this issue so I would appreciate any suggestions. The ZIP folder is smaller than 2GB. </p><p>Many thanks in advance! </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",lashbash85

I have three other accounts with external hosts whose storage capacity is limited. Each email account is for a specific purpose.  I am using IMAP setting for all email accounts.  What I hoped I could do is set up folders in Local folders for each of the limited storage capacity accounts to direct the emails I want to save using the Message Filters.  Not only did it not work, it wiped out the message filters that had been working well for me for ages.  My message filter page is completely blank. </p><p>Being somewhat non-literal, I only recently learned that Local Folders really did mean folders on my hard drive.  So wondering what else I don't know, what happens to the emails I archive.   Are the emails still on the mail server?  Or are archives on my hard drive?  If the archives are on my hard drive and not on the remote mail server drive, are the emails there permanently - i.e., they're there until I delete them, or until something goes wrong with my hard drive?  (Why would anyone think that might happen?) </p><p>If the archives are no longer at the mail server, but are on my hard drive - that would seem to solve my problem.  I thought of the idea of moving emails to the Local Folders because I thought that archiving did not take the emails off the mail server. </p><p>If someone can make sense of all this so I don't stress myself out over what can go where, I will greatly appreciate it.&nbsp;:-} </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1584031;,bdjim

The  Google Calendar app on my Samsung A13 phone running Android 12 shows it correctly on my calendar. If I then edit the event in Thunderbird and save it (even it I don't make changes), I am listed as an attendee to the meeting as well as the organizer. This causes my phone to show the event with a black interior rather than the normal color for events on my calendar. My presumption is that the black interior means the event hasn't been confirmed by all attendees. If I ""remove all attendees"" in Thunderbird for the event, my phone shows it correctly again. </p><p>I saw a similar problem report on the web about Google adding the organizer as an attendee. It said something about being logged in to ""the primary"" calendar when creating the event on a google calendar, but with no explanation about what the ""primary calendar"" is, and the description of that problem isn't exactly what is happening to me. </p><p>Removing all attendees or just living with different colored events on my calendar are viable options, but it is annoying. Any suggestions would be welcome. </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1584022;,gsem66

I have just switched to Thunderbird Beta v114 with the unified inbox folder for all my email accounts and cannot get the inbox to sort this way. I can have the newest emails at the top without the starred emails, but as soon as I put the starred emails at the top all the other emails are sorted in reverse, that is, oldest at the top. I can get the exact opposite of the arrangement I want by putting the starred emails at the foot and then the newest emails, so the oldest emails are at the top. I cannot find any way to reproduce the sort order I always used before moving to v.114. </p>",customize;tbbetasn;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1584019;,joe105
