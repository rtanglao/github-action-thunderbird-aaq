My IT guru has kindly set up my Thunderbird platform so I can receive and view my emails from two different accounts. The problem I'm finding is that emails from both accounts are turning up in my gmail inbox. Also spam is not being filtered. Any help and advice you could give me would be greatly appreciated. Also there is a folder called ""All Mail"" it has over 11,000 emails in it. If I empty it will the emails still be in my inboxes? I've been too scared to do it in fear of losing all emails.  Thank you in advance. </p><p>Jen </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",rjwrev

Why? </p><p>Second, TB continues to vex me with password management.  It's my impression that it changes passwords for accounts on its own, although I know that is unlikely if not impossible.  Furthermore, it hides where it stores passwords from me.  KB articles are no help because they reference menu choices that do not appear in version 114.12.0 64-bit. </p><p>Can someone, please, give me instructions for finding and changing passwords in TB.  My ISP is sending me messages that PW authentication failed.  I finally figured out the navigation to change PWs at my ISP but I cannot find the same in TB.  Before you ask, I store my mail account PWs in a PW manager so that I can recall the last used PW when I encounter these problems. </p><p>Third, does anyone know if there is a limit in TB on the number of accounts it will manage?  I'm having trouble adding accounts despite following the procedures for doing so and receiving confirmation that they have been added; yet they do not appear in the list of accounts in the window at the left of the screen. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",rabbithutch1
