I have a laptop I haven't used for a long time with me on a road trip and I've installed Thunderbird.  When I attempt to add my Gmail account I am asked to enter a 2-step verification code that has been sent to my cellphone.  But the phone number on the Gmail account is a landline number.  I prefer not to give out my cellphone number.  Is a possible work-around to copy Thunderbird settings from the home computer to the laptop?

1416959,2023-06-27 16:00:48 -0700,2023-06-27 23:58:11 -0700,Issues with Thunderbird,"<p>What has happened to Thunderbird?!!  For at least 4 months I've been experiencing issues while using Thunderbird.  It started when a couple more file folders were added, (Not by me), to the ""Folders Group"" under my email address.  Those folders that were added are:  ""JUNK ITEMS"" and ""DELETED ITEMS"".  The only folders I've ever used were the ones that were installed in the beginning many years ago.  They simply read: ""JUNK"" and ""DELETE"".  Yes, I've always updated whenever an update became available. </p><p>I cannot remove the Junk items or the Delete folders from the folder file.  When I attempt to do so, I receive the message which states: ""The following process failed. Messages cannot be ""RENAMED""!  This happens even though I selected the ""Delete Tab"" from the drop-down menu, even though I selected the ""DELETE"" option. To add to all of this now every time I open the Thunderbird program to check my e-mail, it loads those very slowly.  When it's completed the downloads, and I start selecting e-mails to view, I may get through 2 or 3 and they suddenly ""disappear"" from the inbox list.  If I wait for about a minute or less, they suddenly re-appear. </p><p>Another issue is this occurs often while I'm trying to view the remaining e-mails, AND at times some of the e-mails I have ""DELETED"" suddenly re-appear from the ""TRASH FOLDER""!  I have un-installed and re-installed the Thunderbird program without any changes to the issues. </p><p>If I knew how to SAVE all of my e-mails that I keep, and do a ""Restore"" operation without loosing my e-mail files, I'd do that.  I'm currently running Windows 10 on an HP ENVY 700 Series PC and have Centurylink for my ISP. </p><p>Is there anyone who can help me identify what is causing all these issues with Thunderbird?  I would really appreciate any suggestions or help with solving those problems!  Thank you in advance for any assistance! </p><p>John </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1587562;,jmil43

After trying a lot of different filter words, I finally deleted all the filters in Thunderbird. Then created one filter at a time. Starting with other emails from non-Ebay subjects and each person's email name that I created filters for, were filtered properly when I had the program run a filter on that person's email. </p><p>After doing about a dozen different email addresses, I tried an email I have received from Ebay. Used the same format to create a filter for the Ebay email that I had done on all the other emails. But when I then had the program run the filter on the Ebay email, it never left the ""run now"" mode. </p><p>Is there some kind of block on Ebay emails that is in place in Thunderbird? </p><p>If anyone know why only my Ebay mail will not filter and move from my inbox to my Ebay folder, I'd appreciate knowing what I need to do. </p><p>Also when I just tried to ""move"" a single Ebay email to the Ebay folder, which I created and is directly under the IN BOX for my account, as are all of the other folders, the Ebay email never moves from the IN Box. </p><p>Attached are 2 jpg files that show how my folders are set up under my IN BOX. The first shows the top of the folder list starting with the IN BOX. The second shows my EBAY folder in relation to the other folders. It does contain a lot of emails in it. Those were filtered over the past few years. Then suddenly a while back I realized that non of my Ebay mail was being filtered into the folder. </p><p>Fred Berney </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",FredBerney
