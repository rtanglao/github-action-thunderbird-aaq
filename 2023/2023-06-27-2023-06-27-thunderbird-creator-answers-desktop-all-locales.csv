I have several accounts but this happens only on a single outlook365 account. ""place a copy.."" option is unticked but there is something weird, since differently from the other accounts I have, the entries are not greyed out. If I tick and untick the option, the entries became greyed but if I close and re-open the window setting they are not greyed anymore. Thunderbird version is 102.12.0 on Windows 10 and the behaviour also occurs in troubleshoot mode. I have other 2 office365 accounts configured but none of them have this problem.
