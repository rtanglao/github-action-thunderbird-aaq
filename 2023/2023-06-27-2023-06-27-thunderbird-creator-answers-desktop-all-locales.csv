I add calendar items for my sogo caldav connection and no events are visible, yet the event is saved in my sogo server (and appears on my iphone).  I am using thunderbird version 102.12.0 x64 windows 10. </p><p>I have similar problems with the cardav components of thunderbird.  Is it possible that this is a sogo issue or thunderbird? </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",craig92
