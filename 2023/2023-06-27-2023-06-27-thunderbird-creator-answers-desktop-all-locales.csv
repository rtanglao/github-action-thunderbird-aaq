I have tried lots of things like trying to recover them and checking in the bin/ trash folder but I can’t seem to recover them.  Interestingly it is still showing the same amount of space as before I „deleted“ all my emails. </p><p>Appreciate every little tips or help!

I have several accounts but this happens only on a single outlook365 account. ""place a copy.."" option is unticked but there is something weird, since differently from the other accounts I have, the entries are not greyed out. If I tick and untick the option, the entries became greyed but if I close and re-open the window setting they are not greyed anymore. Thunderbird version is 102.12.0 on Windows 10 and the behaviour also occurs in troubleshoot mode. I have other 2 office365 accounts configured but none of them have this problem.

I checked all settings, deleted and reestablished the account (including deleting the profile) several times to no avail.  </p><p>When I try to use the account with other clients such as Opera Mail or Evolution I get the error message: Maximum number of connections from user-IP exceeded (mail_max_userip_connections=25), which means that I somehow have overloaded the IMAP server. That is strange, since I the maximum number of connections I can use is three (one of two stationaries, one mobile device and the webmail service).  </p><p>My service provider is not of much help, saying the error is due to my client (Thunderbird) og something else in my end. The only advice the have is to check the settings and change password. </p><p>I have two account on the same domain with the same provider and only one of them is affected by the error.  </p><p>How do I solve this? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1587434;,morten7
