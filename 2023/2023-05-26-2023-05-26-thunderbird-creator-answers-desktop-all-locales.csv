I have been using this for years. what the hell happened to my program for email? who has the time on checking email to set everything up again? Why wouldn't we be warned this was coming? Do I really have to set up all of my accounts again? What happened to my stored emails and folders that were setup? I am assuming the program updated, but honestly this pisses me off and makes me want to switch clients after decades of use. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",pmruzicka

MY ISP has forced me into Microsoft Office which doesn't support Thunderbird and, annoyed, I've jumped to Proton, which will allow me to continue with Thunderbird and to download my emails.  My question is this: </p><p>Now that my old email address is no longer supported, Thunderbird goes nuts throwing up a constant message about not being able to connect.  How do I stop this without deleting the actual account? (because if I do, I delete the entire database of emails associated with the account.). I just want to disable it so that it doesn't try to connect.  And then I will simply add in my Proton email and carry on from there.  At the moment, I get the message: ""Log in to account ""..."" failed."" and then three buttons - Enter new password, Cancel, Retry - but it doesn't stay concelled.  It just keeps nagging me.  And if I go into account settings, it won't let me disable the SMTP. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",skyreburn

This makes it very hard to use Thunderbird as the focus is constantly changing from the list of messages to another unwanted tab. I have also started seeing this problem in Zotero, which uses the same underlying interface as Thunderbird, so I believe it is a general problem impacting all applications that use that (XUL?) interface. This is not a mouse problem as I have seen this on two different computers using two different mice, one of which is connected to the computer via a cable. I also have not noticed this problem in any of the other applications I use, so it is limited to Mozilla apps (but I have not seen this in Firefox for whatever reason - I believe firefox no longer uses XUL, right?). </p><p>Thanks, David </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",dmkaplan2000

Incoming Server already exists.</strong>  The people at GoDaddy helping me had me sign in directly to the 365 account, which I did with no problem.  They then said I need to contact you, since the problem doesn't seem to be on their end.  After talking with them, I noticed that I didn't have the latest version of Thunderbird, so I updated it, and followed the instructions again at the GoDaddy site.  However, this time there was no option in the Outgoing Server section to enter OAuth2 as the Authentication Method, and the Done button remained grayed out, so I can't proceed further.  Please help me resolve this so I can get my email.  I've been without it for two weeks due to vacation on Maui.  I unchecked the box to email me when someone answers, because I won't get it.  Please do text me at (626) 818-8021 when someone answers. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",Jim382
