Aparece uma mensagem de travamento com opção de envio de relatório de erro (o que diz algumas vezes) mas não tive nenhum retorno. Achei que o problema poderia ter alguma relação com o antivírus e mantive contato com Suporte de meu antivírus Avast e fizemos alguns ajustes e testes e também desativamos temporariamente o programa e mesmo assim o Thunderbird não abriu. Gostaria de saber se tem alguma solução para eu restaurar o acesso ao programa para acessar as mensagens antigas que estão no computador que ele está instalado e que não aparecem em outros programas Thunderbird instalado em outras máquinas que tenho? Porque acredito que se eu reinstalar o programa devo perder todas as mensagens antigas que estavam lá guardadas.

This makes it very hard to use Thunderbird as the focus is constantly changing from the list of messages to another unwanted tab. I have also started seeing this problem in Zotero, which uses the same underlying interface as Thunderbird, so I believe it is a general problem impacting all applications that use that (XUL?) interface. This is not a mouse problem as I have seen this on two different computers using two different mice, one of which is connected to the computer via a cable. I also have not noticed this problem in any of the other applications I use, so it is limited to Mozilla apps (but I have not seen this in Firefox for whatever reason - I believe firefox no longer uses XUL, right?). </p><p>Thanks, David </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",dmkaplan2000
