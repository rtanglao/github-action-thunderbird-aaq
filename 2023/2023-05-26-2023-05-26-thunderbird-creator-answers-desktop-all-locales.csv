I contacted Godaddy, and followed their instructions at <a href=""https://www.godaddy.com/help/add-my-microsoft-365-email-in-thunderbird-mac-and-windows-"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.godaddy.com/help/add-my-microsoft-365-email-in-thunderbird-mac-and-windows-</a> pc-41563?fbclid=IwAR0hHnW_rvYufX3pvN9kxob9XYgiVJtnqyXXNahgmVYBgL7dYuNgG5W2iiw </p><p>When I clicked done at step 8, I got an error message saying <strong>Error Creating account.  Incoming Server already exists.</strong>  The people at GoDaddy helping me had me sign in directly to the 365 account, which I did with no problem.  They then said I need to contact you, since the problem doesn't seem to be on their end.  After talking with them, I noticed that I didn't have the latest version of Thunderbird, so I updated it, and followed the instructions again at the GoDaddy site.  However, this time there was no option in the Outgoing Server section to enter OAuth2 as the Authentication Method, and the Done button remained grayed out, so I can't proceed further.  Please help me resolve this so I can get my email.  I've been without it for two weeks due to vacation on Maui.  I unchecked the box to email me when someone answers, because I won't get it.  Please do text me at (626) 818-8021 when someone answers. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",Jim382
