It helps very much in knowing whether a help article pre-dates the version a user has installed, and in deciding which of similar articles is the most recent, etc. Thanks for considering this! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1582428;,libcub1

I am receiving emails in this account, and now drafts are being saved but not sending.  I have checked every setting and password.  I am at my wits end.  Copying a formatted message from T-bird to gmail is a big extra step.  This is now a weeks worth of hassle.  I've read every help article and most are fore MUCH earlier versions.  I am fully updated on T-bird, Mozilla and using Windows 10.  Two other gmail accounts are working fine on T-bird. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",lorilohman
