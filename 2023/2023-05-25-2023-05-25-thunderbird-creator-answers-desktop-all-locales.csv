One with Google, which works fine. The other is with Outlook and has worked fine until today.  When trying to send or receive messages I get ""Login to server <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> with username failed"".  I know the username and password are correct because I can access Outlook through my browser (Mozilla) with username and password.  Can you please offer some guidance?  Thanks. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",taylor.bucci

I have 22,470 emails that will not download, from April 2022 - April 2019. Is there something in T-Bird I can set to force these to download? Or is there something wrong on the ISP end? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1582443;,mkburdette

In two recent cases I moved two messages from the Spam folder to the Inbox. One of the messages was completely blank except for the subject. The other displayed HTML code instead of the readable messages.  Both messages displayed correctly at my email provider's website.  Is there a way  or can you provide a way to tell Thunderbird to re-import a message? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1582447;,rmrubinsl

Lets call them A1 and A2. last week A1 all of a sudden stopped working. Google asked me password and second pass verification. But when trying to connect to google again a message ""authentication error"" arrived.  </p><p>I then disinstalled TB and downloaded it anew. A2 started working immediately, but when trying to redefine A1 the above message ""Unable to login..."" appeared.  I then tried to define A1 on the TB of the laptop of my girlfriend. There it started working without any problems.  Both PC's have the same TB version and are working under Windows 10 with the same version. Seems to me very strange.  </p><p>Any ideas? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1582445;,aherz10@gmail.com

It helps very much in knowing whether a help article pre-dates the version a user has installed, and in deciding which of similar articles is the most recent, etc. Thanks for considering this! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1582428;1582444;1582446;1582450;,libcub1

I am receiving emails in this account, and now drafts are being saved but not sending.  I have checked every setting and password.  I am at my wits end.  Copying a formatted message from T-bird to gmail is a big extra step.  This is now a weeks worth of hassle.  I've read every help article and most are fore MUCH earlier versions.  I am fully updated on T-bird, Mozilla and using Windows 10.  Two other gmail accounts are working fine on T-bird. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1582449;,lorilohman
