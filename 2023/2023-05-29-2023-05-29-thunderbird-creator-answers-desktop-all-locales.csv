This is the last resort as I've been doing quiet a lot of testing to get this sorted out. </p><p>Case: - Using Outlook 365  - Have successfully added the e-mail to Thunderbird through IMAP settings - I can successfully send and receive e-mail on both desktop and mobile (using Spark on iOS) </p><p>Problem: - When I send an e-mail on desktop, it is added to ""Sent"" folder on mobile. - <strong>HOWEVER, the issue is when sending an e-mail from Spark (iOS), it is not seen on the ""Sent"" folder on desktop where Thunderbird is used. What could be the cause of this happening?</strong> </p><p>What I've tried: - Testing a lot of different settings. This is the only settings where we can both send and receive e-mail on: IMAP: <a href=""http://outlook.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office365.com</a> / SSL TLS / OAuth2 / Port 993. SMTP: <a href=""http://smtp.office365.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.office365.com</a> / Port 587 / OAuth2 / STARTTLS - Removing and adding account more than 10+ times - Made sure, under ""Synchronization and Storage"" in TB, that the top checkbox is checked (Keep all messages in all folders for this account on this computer) </p><p>I might also tell you that syncing works perfectly for everyone else, however, they are using Outlook on both mobile and desktop and using the office 365 login option. Which Thunderbird does not have. </p><p>Anyone have any ideas on what I could test or try in order for iOS and Thunderbird to sync sent msgs properly? That is, sending emails from Spark on iPhone and getting them to the Sent folder in Thunderbird on desktop. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",alexander85

That is why I created a sub-folder in Thunderbird for them, and created a manual filter so that all emails with the email-list's address as addressee are redirected to that sub-folder. I do want to be able to receive all the emails that go to that email list, just in this separate folder, so that it doesn't crowd out my other emails. I set the settings to ""filter before Junk classification"" and I also put that filter on top of all the filters. </p><p>I just realized that many many of the emails to that email list landed in the spam folder instead. The addressee is exactly as stated in my manual filter. It is explicitly set to FIRST go through my manual filter before they can be classified as spam. If Thunderbird did what it says it does, none of these emails should land in the spam folder, because filtered out by my manual filter before. </p><p>Does anyone know why this happens, and how to prevent it? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",isabelkaeslin
