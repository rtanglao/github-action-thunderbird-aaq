I have two GMail accounts, both set us as POP3.   </p><p>Test 1: I send an email from account ""A"" to ""B"" using my Galaxy S23. On the phone, the times are correctly shown in the ""A"" account's Sent folder and in the ""B"" account's Inbox folder. On the laptop, both accounts have the times shifted two hours earlier. </p><p>Test 2: Thinking the problem might just be with one account, I reversed the test and sent an email from ""B"" to ""A"" using my phone.  On the laptop, both were shifted by two hours. </p><p>Test 3: Repeat of Test 1, but using the laptop. No time shift </p><p>Test 4: Repeat of Test 2, but using laptop. No time shift. </p><p>Test 5: Another person sent a test email to both my Gmail accounts. Both show up with the correct timetags in GMail, but both show up in TB on my laptop as being send two hours earlier. </p><p>For all tests, the correct time is shown on the GMail accounts themselves. </p><p>I had no problems like this with the older laptop and I don't have anything on PDST.  The only *hint* might be that Win11Pro was installed in California, but I have no idea how that would have been stored and work its way solely into TB and nowhere else. </p><p>What might be making this happen and how can I correct it? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1583048;1583050;1583054;,weathervane
