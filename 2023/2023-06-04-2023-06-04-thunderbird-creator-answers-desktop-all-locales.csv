One I guess the original, can be listed with  apt list --installed and the other that I installed with flatpak flatpak list </p><p>Unfortunatellly I configured and starte to use the one cane from flatpak. I have set everything, mail rules, digital signature, . . .  etc. Now the actual problem is that the ImportExportTools NG add-on is not able to export my mails. I guess the reason is that I have 2 installed TB instances on my machine. Please advise how I can realize which one I configured and use? 2nd request: how to remove the redundant TB instance while the necessary will not suffer any injury? Thanks.

It should open a page in an existing instance, and open the intended webpage, not my homepage. I might have made a change in preferences that causes this behavior, but I'm not sure. </p><p>Thunderbird Linux 102.11.0 Firefox Linux 113.0.2 Linux Mint 21.1 </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1583851;,software-ff

Every since then whenever I tried to access my gmail accounts with Thunderbird I get the message ""Authentication failure while connecting to server <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>"". I have done research and made sure I have all the correct settings regarding OAuth2 and cookies and whatever in both Gmail and Thunderbird. But I have never been able to get it to work. </p><p>Then suddenly out of the blue I get this login screen for Google that opens in a new Thunderbird window that I haven't seen before. I mean I hadn't even upgraded or restarted Thunderbird for a very long time and it's just been opened in the background working away. So who knows what happened to make that appear. In any case, after I logged into my Google account using that Thunderbird window, and went through the million security notifications from Google about it, I was actually able to access my Gmail account at last. </p><p>The trouble now is that I have several Gmail accounts. And I can only access one this way. The others still give me that authentication error. I have checked to make sure that all account settings are exactly the same, and they are. </p><p>What can I do to get my other Gmail accounts working in Thunderbird? Is there anyway I can trigger Thunderbird into giving me that Google login windows for my other accounts? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",firefox2338

Now, I just need to add 12 new contacts to a small existing group. Each time I add one name/address, the screen goes back to square one so to speak. I must be doing something wrong! It shouldn't be this cumbersome. I just want to type in all the new folks and THEN hit okay once.  </p><p>I may even have asked this question before, but I can't find anything about it in the help. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",EastTenn
