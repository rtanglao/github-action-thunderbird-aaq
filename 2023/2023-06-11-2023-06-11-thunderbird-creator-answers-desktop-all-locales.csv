I have tried deleting and reinstalling the software and immediately after a test email got through. But that did not last. I have checked my outgoing mail server and it remains unaltered as <a href=""http://mail.internode.on.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.internode.on.net</a> I have also tried turning off my firewall in my Norton 360 software. </p><p>I am able to send emails using internode web mail. I am using the latest version of windows 11 (64) I have been using your software for many many years and never had a problem before. I have not changed anything on my computer to cause this problem. Please help. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",enichols1962
