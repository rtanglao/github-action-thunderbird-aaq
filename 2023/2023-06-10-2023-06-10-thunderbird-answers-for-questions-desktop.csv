Based on your suggestion and my findings, I went back into Outlook, grabbed one of the 111 problem files, and looked at the source: Even though the Subject and date stamp are shown correctly, the source is WRONG!!!! The source has the same errant Subject and date stamp as was imported! I checked a couple more and found the same. </p><p>Okay, so re-importing is out. But stepping away from what I can do for a minute to what happened. I think I know: Since I've been sending this series to the same several people, I have created each new message by opening the previous message and selecting ""Resend"". I'm guessing that Outlook sees all the 111 messages as the same message repeated. (I've done this a few times with TB accounts also [Edit as New Message]; I'll have to look back at their source.) </p><p>Back to fixing: So okay, if I decide I can't live with 111 ""identical"" messages, is it possible to edit the underlying file? I make this to be: </p><pre>[Identity]\[profile]\Mail\Local Folders\Outlook.sbd\Sent Items </pre> <p>And more importantly, if I do edit here, is there any kind of character count or coding within the file that will cause me to trash the file if I change it?

I still have 111 (I counted them since posting) messages with same subject line and date/time.

Errant messages are part of a series I've sent out, and Subject of each starts with same content. They also go to several Bcc's.
