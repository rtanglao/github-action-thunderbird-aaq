That is set by Shaw and can probably be reset somewhere on their web site. I would expect their support folk to advise you of how and where. </p><p>However, requests for passwords that suddenly start out of the blue are rarely password issues.  Quite often it is a new version of the software (thunderbird) not being recognized by some security suite or antivirus and blocking the access. </p><p>Restarting Thunderbird in troubleshooting mode on a device that is also in troubleshooting mode with networking should offer some clues as to the cause </p>",MattAuSupport,false,1,1

Antivirus programs routinely use self signed certificates that Thunderbird does not trust.   If you have any sort of VPN then again it may well be using self signed certificates.
