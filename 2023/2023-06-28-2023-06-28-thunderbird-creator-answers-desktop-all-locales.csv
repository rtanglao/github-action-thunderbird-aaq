It's for an email account that I use a fair amount and was having problems with another email browser that I had tried, that developed a bug and gave error messages when trying to attach files.  Figured I""d see if TB was a viable option.   </p><p>I have searched through various threads and read about this problem and answers involving changing something in ""CSS"" whatever that is, but is this really the current state of affairs?  Seems pretty basic.  You may have been talking on the phone, going to the bathroom etc., and want to know if an email came in, you should be able to just look at the icon on the taskbar and see if there's anything new.  Otherwise you may have to be clicking the icon 50 times a day to see if you have mail, and then getting tired of doing that and not knowing something came that you missed.  I know you all know this.  Just thought I'd spell out the problem.   </p><p>Before I gave up on TB and looked for another option, I figured I ask the forum and see if there was something I was missing, which could certainly be the case. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1587718;1587728;1587731;1587742;1587768;1587770;1587815;1587816;1587820;,fhoran1
