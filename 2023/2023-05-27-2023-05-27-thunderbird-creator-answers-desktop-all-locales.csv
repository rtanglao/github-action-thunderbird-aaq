""Will the new Supernova interface and Thunderbird redesign cause problems with or disable old extensions?"" </p><p>It's very frustrating to have to spend hours finding extension replacements when the old ones no longer work. The last time a TB update changed things like this, I had to waste a lot of time doing this. I had to hold off on updating TB for weeks in fact, because doing so would have disabled so many critical extensions that I was using. Eventually, I was able to find replacement extensions (usually having to embrace feature degradation though) and in other cases simply had to give up conveniences that I had grown to take for granted. </p><p>I don't welcome the prospect of having to do this kind of thing all over again. </p>",customize;tbbetasn;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1582816;,r9jmg0

I can see they exist somewhere, as they are indexed, and I can read the first few lines, date and address etc, but not open them fully. I found this earlier which mentions sqlite? I don't know what that is or whether it might be part of the solution. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1018203"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1018203</a> </p><p>If anyone knows how to retrieve the content of these emails I'd be very grateful.

Miksi näitä ohjelmia pitää aina tehdä ikävämmäksi käyttää. Yksinkertaisuus on tärkeä tekiä.

Most people have that address. However, unless I'm missing something, in Thunderbird, I can set it up as the default Reply To address, but not as a permanent From address, so, unless I use the Custom Address each time, people end up with a second or third or fourth email address for me in their Contacts. I assume it's not possible to set up a permanent Custom Address? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1582766;1582812;,Tombarkas

I've done all the account setting/outgoing server rebuilds and made sure the user name and description fields are the same.  I've checked in the individual accounts in the outgoing server settings.  What next?  I've deleted the account in outgoing server and added it back.  Nothing seems to work.  Never had this problem before.  I would say it's been going on for about 2-3 weeks.  Took me a while to discover it. </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",300perkins
