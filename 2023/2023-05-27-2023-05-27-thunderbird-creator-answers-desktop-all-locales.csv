I've done all the account setting/outgoing server rebuilds and made sure the user name and description fields are the same.  I've checked in the individual accounts in the outgoing server settings.  What next?  I've deleted the account in outgoing server and added it back.  Nothing seems to work.  Never had this problem before.  I would say it's been going on for about 2-3 weeks.  Took me a while to discover it. </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",300perkins
