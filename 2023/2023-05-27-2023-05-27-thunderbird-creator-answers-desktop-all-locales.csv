I can see they exist somewhere, as they are indexed, and I can read the first few lines, date and address etc, but not open them fully. I found this earlier which mentions sqlite? I don't know what that is or whether it might be part of the solution. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1018203"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1018203</a> </p><p>If anyone knows how to retrieve the content of these emails I'd be very grateful. Many thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",FlightReturn

Miksi näitä ohjelmia pitää aina tehdä ikävämmäksi käyttää. Yksinkertaisuus on tärkeä tekiä. Antaisin mielelläni rahaa teille, mutta miksi maksaa huononnuksista ja typeristä  muutoksista. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,fi,"",jarmo111111

Most people have that address. However, unless I'm missing something, in Thunderbird, I can set it up as the default Reply To address, but not as a permanent From address, so, unless I use the Custom Address each time, people end up with a second or third or fourth email address for me in their Contacts. I assume it's not possible to set up a permanent Custom Address? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",Tombarkas

I've done all the account setting/outgoing server rebuilds and made sure the user name and description fields are the same.  I've checked in the individual accounts in the outgoing server settings.  What next?  I've deleted the account in outgoing server and added it back.  Nothing seems to work.  Never had this problem before.  I would say it's been going on for about 2-3 weeks.  Took me a while to discover it. </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",300perkins
