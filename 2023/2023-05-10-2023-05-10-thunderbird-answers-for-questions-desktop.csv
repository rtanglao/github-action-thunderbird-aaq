Is there a way to fix this? </p><p><br> If you are copying emails back emails onto the org gmail mail account then there are limits which gmail impose. So if you have a lot of emails you are trying to upload then yes, it is going to take a while. You can only upload a certain amount each day. You can persist with this and it will work, but it will take time. See info: <a href=""https://support.google.com/a/answer/1071518?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/a/answer/1071518?hl=en</a> </p><p><br> 2) Is there another way I can share/copy the emails via some other device/program that will allow the org to read and access the emails (i.e, external hard drive, but not sure what format the export would need to be for them to be able to access/read the emails?) </p><p>david has already mentioned one method, but you do not need to export a profile. It contains tons of information the recipient does not need and then they would have to work out where the emails are stored and may still need to convert them. </p><p>Thunderbird stores emails in mbox text files. It is possible to export in various formats. Regarding the person who wants the emails returned to the organisation - do they use Thunderbird&nbsp;? If no, what email client are they using or do they use webmail only&nbsp;? But to be honest, if you supply the files containing emails then you have done your duty. It would be their problem on how they put the emails back on the server. But it would be helpful to provide them in a format which is preferable.  </p><p>If you want to send all emails in a .eml format. Do the following to get a folder containing a load of individual emails in .eml format. </p><p>If you have all the emails in a Thunderbird folder - lets call it 'OldMail' folder because I have no idea where you have put them. </p><p>Create a new folder on your desktop called 'OrgEmails' </p><p>In Thunderbird </p> <ul><li> Select the 'OldMail' folder (whatever folder has the organisation emails) </li><li> Click on first email in the Message List to get focus on list </li><li> Hold down 'Ctrl' key and press 'A' key - This highlights all the emails in the folder.  </li><li> Right click on highlighted emails and select 'Save as' </li><li> Window opens asking where to save - locate Desktop and select the 'OrgEmails' folder in list </li><li> click on 'Select Folder' button </li></ul> <p><br> All the emails you highlighted will now get copied as individual emails with .eml extension into the folder on the desktop called 'OrgEmails'.  Allow a little time for this process to complete if you have a lot of emails in that selected folder. </p><p>Now convert to a zip folder: </p> <ul><li> Right click on 'OrgEmails' folder and select 'Send to' and choose compressed zip option. </li><li> You should have a 'OrgEmail.zip' folder containing all emails and it's probably half the size of the original 'OrgEmails' folder. </li></ul> <p><br> <strong>Alternative option</strong> - access file that contains all the emails and create a copy. On desktop create a folder called 'OrgEmails'  </p><p>In Thunderbird: </p> <ul><li> Menu icon &gt; Help &gt; More Troubleshooting Information </li><li> Half way down is 'Profile Folder'  - click on 'Show in Finder'  </li></ul> <p>A window opens showing contents of your profile name folder. </p> <ul><li> Exit Thunderbird now - this is important. </li></ul> <p>If you have the emails in a POP or 'Local Folders' mail account: </p> <ul><li> click on 'Mail' folder </li></ul> <p>If you have emails in an Imap account: </p> <ul><li> click on 'ImapMail' folder </li></ul> <ul><li> click on mail account name folder </li><li> locate the mbox file which has same name as the folder that contains emails - let's pretend it's called 'OldMail'.  The mbox file that contains all the emails will not have any extension. </li><li> Right click on relevant mbox file and select 'Copy' </li><li> Paste that copy into the folder called 'OrgEmails' </li></ul> <p>Convert 'OrgEmails' folder to a zip folder: </p> <ul><li> Right click on 'OrgEmails' folder and select 'Send to' and choose compressed zip option. </li><li> You should have a 'OrgEmail.zip' folder containing all emails and it's probably half the size of the original 'OrgMails' folder. </li></ul> <p><br> </p><p><br> You now have two options send either a mbox file or eml files.

Of course <em>you</em> can import, because i never alleged any <em>global</em> coding error, ergo as long as your ICS file is not corrupt, then naturally it imports. As my OP showed, including pic, <em>my</em> ICS file clearly is a problem. <strong>I would love to know how i can troubleshoot it, &amp; ideally fix it</strong>.  </p><p>Regarding your... </p><p>&gt;When I right click on an event all I see is: ""Open"", ""ConvertTo"" and ""Delete Event"". I am (not yet&nbsp;:-) ) a TB calendar expert but I don't think there is a duplicate event menu item </p><p>...that's most surprising to me. Btw, i never asserted TB had a `Duplicate Event` context-menu item. What i said was... </p><p>&gt;Both Ctrl-C Ctrl-V, &amp; RMB-Copy RMB-Paste, simply do NOTHING [for it seems like the majority (but not entirety) of my Events].  </p><p>...ie, the way to duplicate an event is to copy it, then paste it on the target day. Here's a pic of the context-menu, attached. I cannot understand how your context-menu is missing some of these options. Now, in preparation tonight for replying to you, i did more tests, &amp; realised that i need to edit part of my OP. The now-<em>wrong</em> part is pasted immediately prior to this paragraph. The <em>corrected</em> replacement is... </p><p>&gt;Both Ctrl-C Ctrl-V, &amp; RMB-Copy RMB-Paste, simply do NOTHING [for it seems like only <em>some</em> of my Events, &amp; those being older than several years]. </p><p>In other words, it now seems that duplicating any of my events from the past few years works fine, but frequently fails for old events [eg, ~5 or 10 years ago].  </p><p>Re your... </p><p>&gt;Please try Thunderbird Troubleshoot Mode (if you haven't already) </p><p>...yes i have done this, but it makes no difference, ie, more recent events still duplicate, old events still often fail silently to duplicate.  </p><p>Re your... </p><p>&gt;Please let us know: your email provider  e.g. gmail, your calendar provider e.g. google, what 3rd party software like add-ons, anti-virus or firewalls you are using </p><p>...with respect, how is any of that relevant? We're talking about my <strong>ICS data</strong>, <em>not my email data</em>, &amp; [you did not know this <em>before</em>, but from my current reply you <em>now</em> do] the fact that `Troubleshoot Mode` [ie, disables all AddOns, `user.js` etc] does not help, logically eliminates any of those extraneous factors as being causal.  </p> <ul><li><ul><li><ul><li> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> <p><strong>TL;DR: I would love to know how i can troubleshoot my ICS data, &amp; ideally fix it.</strong> </p>",MsDropbear,false,0,0

Select ""Privacy &amp; Security"" or ""Junk"" settings. Disable or adjust the Junk Mail filtering options. Restart Thunderbird and check if the emails display correctly.

Try adjusting the message display settings: </p><p>Open Thunderbird. Go to ""View"" or ""Options"" from the menu bar. Select ""Display"" or ""Reading &amp; Display"" settings. Look for options related to message format, HTML display, or plain text settings. Experiment with different settings and restart Thunderbird to see if the issue is resolved. Verify Thunderbird version compatibility: Ensure that you have the latest version of Thunderbird installed on your system. Compatibility issues can sometimes arise if you're using an outdated version. Check for updates and install any available updates to see if it resolves the problem. </p><p>Check Thunderbird message filters: It's possible that there are misconfigured message filters in Thunderbird that are causing the issue. Review your message filters and rules to ensure they are set up correctly and not inadvertently modifying the email format. </p><p>Consult Thunderbird support and forums: If the issue persists, it would be helpful to seek assistance from the Thunderbird support community or forums. Other users or experts might have encountered a similar problem and could provide specific guidance or workarounds. </p><p>By following these steps and seeking further assistance if needed, you should be able to address the issue with emails displaying in a non-standard format in Thunderbird. </p>",lazizakhmedov1014,false,0,0

Thunderbird uses the default colour palette provided by Windows OS which by default does not provide what you or I would like. </p><p>If however you are using the prepaid programs MS Word, Excel  then it's possible to save a set of preselected colours as a design colour set which you can reselect, but only in those programs. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,1,0
