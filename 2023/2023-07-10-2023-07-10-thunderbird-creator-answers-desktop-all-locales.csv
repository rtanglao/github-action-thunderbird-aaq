All accounts were set up using protocols pulled from the TB database when the accounts were first registered, and using primary or app passwords where required to support 2-factor-authorisation. </p><p>All of these accounts, except iCloud, present all folders created in the email accounts, and work perfectly. For the iCloud account, sending and receiving emails work perfectly, but only those folders that have been created since the original registration in TB can be seen and accessed. Those additional folders have definitely been successfully synchronised back to the original online account, but the remainder of the folders and subfolders that still exist in the online account since it was originally created (none appear to have been lost) are not synchronising with the TB iCloud account, and are not appearing in TB under the iCloud account name. </p><p>I have tried deleting the iCloud account from TB - having checked that the folders that exist in the TB iCloud account have been synchronised back to the main online account - then adding the iCloud account back again using a freshly-generated Apple ID app password, but the problem remains: none of the non-TB generated folders appear in the TB iCloud account. I noticed that TB spent a considerable time checking for additional folders in the iCloud account immediately after adding the account, and after the previously TB-generated folders became visible, but no more folders were synchronised after that. </p><p>I found an older Mozilla Support question concerning exactly this problem, but the topic was archived before a solution to this problem could be suggested. In that thread, it was suggested to check the flag in the properties for the folder, ""When getting new messages for this account, always check this folder"", and set the flag if not already set. This 'solution' is not valid for this problem, as the TB folder properties can only be checked if the folder is visible, and setting the flag made to difference to this behaviour. Interestingly though, when I performed that suggested check, none of those flags were already set for the folders that are visible.  </p><p>Can anyone account for this behaviour? It seems to me that it might be an issue of authority of access to the folders in the original online iCloud account, but I'm not an expert in these matters. </p><p>Can anyone suggest how to fix this? </p><p>Can anyone suggest, is this an Apple iCloud email problem, or a Thunderbird problem?

I have it working now, but one of the steps I took to get it to work was to edit the Thunderbird configuration. I changed security.tls.version.min from 3 to 1. I have changed it back to 3 now and my email account is continuing to work. TO me this suggests that security.tls.version.min is setting another variable somewhere that is not listed in the config. I am also confused why TLS would have a min version value of 3 by default. The latest version of TLS is 1.3 (at time of writing this). Is the tls.version.min also being used for SSL - which does in fact have a version 3.0? I just thought I should bring this to your attention because there seems to be a lot of talk in other forums about changing the tls.version.min to 1 to fix issues, and that doesn't work for all other issues and reducing the min version can create new issues - especially if my suspicion is correct, that it is also being used for SSL - ie security certificates. If this is the case, as a feature update, should SSL and TLS be given their own version config parameters in Thunderbird?

This worked fine up through TB 68 by modifying network.protocol-handler.app.http (and .https) to specify the complete command line as ""C:\Program Files (x86)\BraveSoftware\Brave-Browser\Application\brave.exe"" --user-data-dir=""E:\My Documents\Brave\User Data"" --disk-cache-size=104857600 -–process-per-site -- ""%1"". </p><p>This broke in TB 91 and 102 with the handler selections moved to handlers.json.  From what I've read so far, it's not possible to modify the ""path"" variable to work with additional arguments. </p><p>I've also edited the registry settings for ""BraveHTML\shell\open\command"" to include the same arguments. </p><p>Via the TB UI, http and https point to Brave (I've tried ""default"" and explicit).  Running MS Process Monitor, I can see TB open that registry key and then ignore it and just launch brave.exe with no arguments. </p><p>I also tried setting the target to a .bat file which has the desired command line.  Process Monitor shows TB opens that file.  Brave is launched but does not honor the command line arguments.  MS Process Explorer shows what looks like the fully correct command line including the URL passed from TB. </p><p>Is there a way to get this to work again?  I've considered the mklink option but am nervous that it might actually overwrite the real profile location. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",newsletters1
