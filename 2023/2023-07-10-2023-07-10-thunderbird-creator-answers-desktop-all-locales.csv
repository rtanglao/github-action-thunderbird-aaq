It does not appear in my incoming emails, nor in my junk folder.  On my new iPad, this persons emails end up in my junk folder.  I've selected this persons past emails and did a COM + J to mark it as not junk, but it is still be blocked.  There have been no changes to my desktop operating system and all other emails appear to be working fine.  The fact that it shows up on my iPad junk folder but not on my desktop junk folded is particularly baffling.  Thanks for any suggestions, Gary </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",Gary91

I have it working now, but one of the steps I took to get it to work was to edit the Thunderbird configuration. I changed security.tls.version.min from 3 to 1. I have changed it back to 3 now and my email account is continuing to work. TO me this suggests that security.tls.version.min is setting another variable somewhere that is not listed in the config. I am also confused why TLS would have a min version value of 3 by default. The latest version of TLS is 1.3 (at time of writing this). Is the tls.version.min also being used for SSL - which does in fact have a version 3.0? I just thought I should bring this to your attention because there seems to be a lot of talk in other forums about changing the tls.version.min to 1 to fix issues, and that doesn't work for all other issues and reducing the min version can create new issues - especially if my suspicion is correct, that it is also being used for SSL - ie security certificates. If this is the case, as a feature update, should SSL and TLS be given their own version config parameters in Thunderbird?

This worked fine up through TB 68 by modifying network.protocol-handler.app.http (and .https) to specify the complete command line as ""C:\Program Files (x86)\BraveSoftware\Brave-Browser\Application\brave.exe"" --user-data-dir=""E:\My Documents\Brave\User Data"" --disk-cache-size=104857600 -â€“process-per-site -- ""%1"". </p><p>This broke in TB 91 and 102 with the handler selections moved to handlers.json.  From what I've read so far, it's not possible to modify the ""path"" variable to work with additional arguments. </p><p>I've also edited the registry settings for ""BraveHTML\shell\open\command"" to include the same arguments. </p><p>Via the TB UI, http and https point to Brave (I've tried ""default"" and explicit).  Running MS Process Monitor, I can see TB open that registry key and then ignore it and just launch brave.exe with no arguments. </p><p>I also tried setting the target to a .bat file which has the desired command line.  Process Monitor shows TB opens that file.  Brave is launched but does not honor the command line arguments.  MS Process Explorer shows what looks like the fully correct command line including the URL passed from TB. </p><p>Is there a way to get this to work again?  I've considered the mklink option but am nervous that it might actually overwrite the real profile location. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",newsletters1
