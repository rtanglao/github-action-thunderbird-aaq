The simple strategy is to save the old messages in a separate folder instead of merging with the existing folders. You can do that by exiting Thunderbird and copying the message folders to the profile at Mail\Local Folders folder. You can access the profile by clicking help&gt;moreroubleshootinginformation, scroll down to 'profile folder' and click 'open folder.' Then, exit Thunderbird and you will be in the Profile with the Mail folder in the folder list. The old message folders will be in sets of two (e.g. INBOX.msf and INBOX). </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

It 'sounds like' you want a new email account. If so, you can get a free one at several places, such as <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>, <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, <a href=""http://gmx.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmx.com</a>. <a href=""http://usa.com"" rel=""nofollow"">usa.com</a> among others. You cannot change one account to another. The process is to add the new account and then delete the old account. I hope this is helpful, as I am only guessing at your issue. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
