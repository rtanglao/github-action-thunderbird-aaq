However, I am wanting to get my Apple Mail program on to the Thunderbird platform and do away with Braxmail. This is because of where I live, using the BraX2 phone is not working for me. I want to access my mail from my iphone, which isn't supported on the Brax phone. (That phone is Google and Apple free.) I want to be able to change over all my Braxmail info on to the Thunderbird version of Apple Mail, and then do away with Braxmail. But because Braxmail is already using Thunderbird, is it actually possible to set up another Thunderbird version for Apple Mail? I can't delete Braxmail, as there's too much valuable info there. I need to import it to Thunderbird' Apple Mail equivalent. Can anyone steer me in the right direction? Thanks!
