Solved my cannot send problem,but the solution makes me nervous.","<p>Hello: Last time before today when I sent email was 23Oct 21!  What fixed it was setting the outgoing server settings to ""Authentication method: Password transmitted insecurely,and Connection security: none. I got a pop-up asking for my password,and my email was sent normally. My reason for posting this is to ask if this outgoing server setting is safe to use. I haven't tried this solution before,as I am very security conscious. I am attaching a pic of the settings.

But then I scratched arround trying to hook up my address books. Then I found the import function. But when I tried to use it the program crashed. (Note, my .default folder is on a different drive.)

However, I am wanting to get my Apple Mail program on to the Thunderbird platform and do away with Braxmail. This is because of where I live, using the BraX2 phone is not working for me. I want to access my mail from my iphone, which isn't supported on the Brax phone. (That phone is Google and Apple free.) I want to be able to change over all my Braxmail info on to the Thunderbird version of Apple Mail, and then do away with Braxmail. But because Braxmail is already using Thunderbird, is it actually possible to set up another Thunderbird version for Apple Mail? I can't delete Braxmail, as there's too much valuable info there. I need to import it to Thunderbird' Apple Mail equivalent. Can anyone steer me in the right direction? Thanks!
