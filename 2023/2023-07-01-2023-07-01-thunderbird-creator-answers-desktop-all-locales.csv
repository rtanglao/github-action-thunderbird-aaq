I have read many posts and checked everything I understood (don't want to make things worse) and all settings appear the same on each account. I have no idea where the problem lies and would appreciate a simple (not really technical)answer if anyone can help me. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",marilynjohnston67
