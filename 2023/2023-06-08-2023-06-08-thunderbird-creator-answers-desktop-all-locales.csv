In the previous version of Thunderbird the default view of collapsed view remained after changing folders. It no longer stays collapsed. When I collapse the views in the Inbox, switch to another folder, then switch back, the view is expanded again. How do I keep the view from expanding keeping views in collapsed mode; keeping it collapsed every time I switch to another folder and return. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",sitesvisited
