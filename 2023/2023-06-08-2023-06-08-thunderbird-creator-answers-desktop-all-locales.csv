In any case my back up machine fell and got broken and can’t be copied except for $1,500+&nbsp;!! I have a second hand MacAir coming in two days. I want to be able to get all my TB program onto this MacAir.  I still am a volunteer for a 13 year old charity scholarship program in Haiti and although I’m 85, I still have lots of work to do on computer—mainly news letters, and advertising for fundraising. So, if you can help me, I will be most pleased. I did find the YouTube coverage of how to transfer TB from one machine to another.  A pro Mac company is going to help me rescue my TB from my dying MacBook and I want to give him all the help he can use.  Oh and somehow I never saved my password for Thunderbird, my computer had it saved so I was able to use it.  But now, not sure whether my TB on my old MacBook will also have the password saved.????? Many thanks for this and for all the years of providing TB for me!!!!! </p><p>Tom Luce [removed emails from public forum] (my two emails, [removed phone# from public forum] [removed full address] </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1584486;,tomfluce

Same version of TBird on each laptop. As the last step in this simple process, a GoDaddy window/web page pops up asking to verify Microsoft365 account credentials. On one laptop (Win7), this window contains a normal display with fields to enter password, etc. I am able to complete the process on this laptop, and it works fine. On the second laptop (Win11), the process is the same, and the same window appears, but it is blank. There are no fields to enter the required data. I've worked on this for a week now, changing default browsers, various settings, and have spent much time on the phone with GoDaddy support, all to no avail. I suspect the problem is in TBird, but I have no idea how to find it. Support for ""Normal Password"" authentication has been dropped, so this email account will not work until I change authentication to ""Oauth"". Help. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",john919
