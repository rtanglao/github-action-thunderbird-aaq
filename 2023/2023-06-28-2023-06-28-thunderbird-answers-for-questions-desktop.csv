I had those options checked and just redid it and then sent myself a message from a different email browser.  </p><p>It looks like that should do the job but it doesn't make any change to the icon when new mail comes in. Again the concept is wanting to know that a new message has come in just by glancing at it rather than opening it fruitlessly multiple times throughout the day. Not sure if this is something in my system but it tells me that this is the most up-to-date version of TB so not sure what the problem might be. Thanks again for the response </p>",fhoran1,false,0,0

In that folder is the profile folder, possibly named Thunderbird. In that folder, look for the Mail folder for POP accounts and the Imapmail folder for IMAP accounts.  I have seen multiple approaches to portable versions, but I think this info will get you there. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0
