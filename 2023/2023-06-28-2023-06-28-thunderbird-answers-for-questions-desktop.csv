I may just have to live with it but I also have not been able to figure out how to add addresses to my address book from the address bar in new emails.  By that I mean that when I enter a new address to the ""To"" line or just am replying to an email from someone who isn't in my address book, I am used to having that new address automatically entered in my address book or being able to right click to set it up manually.  It doesn't look like TB has that option either or I just haven't found it.  These seem like pretty common features in other email browsers.   </p><p>These problems are obviously not crises but may lead me to look for other browser options.

I had those options checked and just redid it and then sent myself a message from a different email browser.  </p><p>It looks like that should do the job but it doesn't make any change to the icon when new mail comes in. Again the concept is wanting to know that a new message has come in just by glancing at it rather than opening it fruitlessly multiple times throughout the day. Not sure if this is something in my system but it tells me that this is the most up-to-date version of TB so not sure what the problem might be. Thanks again for the response </p>",fhoran1,false,0,0

Are the junk flame icons a grey colour or a red/orange colour&nbsp;?
