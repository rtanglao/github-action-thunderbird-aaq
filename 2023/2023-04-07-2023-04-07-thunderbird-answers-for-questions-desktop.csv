Emails get downloaded initially and then only new mail gets auto downloaded. However, that depends upon whether you are synchronising emails - downloading full copies or whether you only downloaded headers in which case each email is downloaded from server when you select to view it. </p><p>You should not be repeatedly trying to download same emails.  Have you subscribed to see all the folders or where you just downloading to a couple of them at a time before subscribing to see more of them? </p><p>The message in last image says 'downloading message 9 of 4 ATB Banking' Agree that is weird.  How many emails are currently in the imap ATB Banking folder?

Again it may be just as easy to post an image showing all on that page. </p><p><br> Imap accounts can download full copies of emails or just headers and that can be done on a per folder basis.  In Account Settings &gt; Synchronisation &amp; Storage What have you got set up? Is this selected&nbsp;: 'Keep messages in all folders for this account on this computer'&nbsp;? Click on 'Advanced..' button Is every folder and subfolder selected or are some selected and others not selected? What do you see? </p><p>What is selected under 'Disk Space'&nbsp;? </p><p>It may be quicker to post info if you uploaded some images. </p><p><br> <strong>Anti-Virus</strong> Advise given regarding Anti-Virus software was good advise. You do not want any Anti-Virus messing about with any of the emails that get downloaded nor any of the files that store emails.  Do not scan incoming or outgoing mail and do not allow Anti-Virus to auto fix anything. In addition I suggest you do not allow it to scan any Thunderbird profile folder or it's contents as it can play havoc with files that store emails. </p><p><strong>Firewall - </strong> Thunderbird program should be set up as an allowed program otherwise it can be awkward about allowing access to internet. </p><p>Advise you never only rely on whatever is held on server because it is only one copy.  Any imap account can also effect what is on server because they are in effect one and the same. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0
