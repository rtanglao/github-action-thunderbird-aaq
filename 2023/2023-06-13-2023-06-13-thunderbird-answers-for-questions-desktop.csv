To clean out your overflowing piles of messages, delete everything you don't want, and then either <strong>Empty the Trash</strong> (there's a control for that) or select everything in the Trash folder that you don't want, and click <strong>Delete forever</strong>. </p><p><strong>Empty the Trash</strong> and <strong>Delete forever</strong> remove those messages from All Mail. </p><p>Once you transfer messages from your IMAP boxes to your local folders, you have them permanently, but they are not completely out of the Gmail system until you delete them from All Mail and from the Trash. A shortcut method I use is this: I select all of the messages I want to move to local folders for safekeeping, then right-click on the selected block of messages and choose Copy To and follow the choices down to the folder I want to put them in. Now they're in the local folder, and while the block of messages is still selected, I click the Delete button. The last step, since I never use Trash as a storage folder for anything I really might want later, is to right-click the main Trash folder and click Empty Trash. They're gone from the Inbox, gone from the All Mail folder, and gone from the Trash. They're only present in the local folder I put them in. </p><p>It's because that All Mail folder is a confused and confusing nuisance that many users unsubscribe from it in Gmail (you can just Hide it in the Gmail Settings &gt; labels section, and uncheck Show in Imap, and you'll not be bothered by it again). </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

There are no messages in Trash.  </p><p>I've just now unsubscribed from All Mail. I then moved 32 messages to local folders (31 of which I changed to Read). Number of Unread in Inbox down by 31, total in Inbox down by 32, number of unread in All Mail unknown (folder visible only in browser, which doesn't show Unread), total in All Mail still 4587.

However, I've tried all these settings and have seen no change (seem to be missing the right combination).  </p><p>In another account in another profile, I tried setting TB to Server Settings&gt;Server Settings&gt;When I delete a message: to Just mark it deleted. The two messages I then moved still appear in the Inbox in TB, with cross-out, but they're gone from my phone, but they're still in Inbox and All Mail in browser. I changed the setting back to Remove it immediately and moved one of them again to local folder, and they both then disappeared from Inbox in TB, but remained in Inbox in browser. I didn't think that would work, and boy was I right! (I deleted them from Inbox in browser and they're gone from All Mail.) </p><p>Back to the account/profile I'm setting up now, I set Gmail&gt;Settings&gt;...IMAP to Auto-expunge on (which makes the Archive the message (Default) the only choice) and in TB moved 16 messages. Inbox in both TB and browser down by 16. All Mail still at 4587. Trash still empty. </p><p>As I say, I can't seem to find a combination that works to delete all these messages. </p>",mdforme,false,0,0
