Your workaround is basically a slightly different way to move the Thunderbird data. Unfortunately, it did not work and I have been thoroughly surprised. </p><p>I copied the Thunderbird folder from the source (my old computer) on a thumb drive and it appeared that there were lots of files within the folder, so I assume it did a proper job of copying the contents of the folder. I then brought it to the new computer, went on Windows Explorer, and attempted to find the appropriate location for the folder. I went to C:\users\&lt;myid&gt;\ and that is where I saw the problem. There is no folder by the name of AppData.  </p><p>This morning, when I was trying to transfer the data, some kind of app or program by the name of duet display appeared on my computer. I then did a little bit of research and it seems as though some other people have complained about this program appearing mysteriously on their computers. Based upon what I've read, which I do not thoroughly understand, I decided to uninstall that program. I don't know if this has anything to do with the disappearance of the AppData folder, but it is as good an explanation as any, especially since I can still find a file with the name duet display on it. </p><p>If I uninstall Thunderbird and then reinstall it, will the AppData folder be re-created along with the roaming and thunderbird files under it? Otherwise, I may be stuck restoring the computer to its default settings and I am certain that having to reinstall programs will probably cause more problems.
