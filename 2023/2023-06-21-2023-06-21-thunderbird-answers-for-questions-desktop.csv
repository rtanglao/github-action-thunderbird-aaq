Try creating a new test address book, add a test contact manually, create a test mailing list in the book, then add the contact by drag and drop (onto the list icon). </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0

The way it normally works, and works on my setup, is that when a contact is added to a mailing list by drag and drop, it's added to the list, but remains in the address book.  If a contact is dragged from one address book to another, the contact is moved, i.e. it is removed from the source and added to the target.  Holding Ctrl while dragging and dropping will copy the contact, not move it. </p>",sfhowes,false,0,0
