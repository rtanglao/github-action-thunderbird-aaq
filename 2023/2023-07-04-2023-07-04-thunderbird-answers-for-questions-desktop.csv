(<a href=""https://gitlab.com/CardBook/CardBook"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitlab.com/CardBook/CardBook</a>). Once I disabled it, I could add the above remote address book. </p>",valentin.brasov,false,0,0

Look for a ""Sign In"" or ""Login"" option on their website and click on it. On the sign-in page, look for a ""Forgot Password,"" ""Reset Password,"" or similar option. Click on it. You might be asked to provide your email address or username associated with the account. Enter the required information. Depending on your email provider, you'll receive password reset instructions via an alternative email address, a mobile phone number, or you might be prompted to answer security questions. Follow the instructions provided by your email provider to reset your password. Once you've reset your password, open Thunderbird and update the password for your email account in Thunderbird's account settings. To do this, go to ""Tools"" (or ""Options"") &gt; ""Account Settings"" &gt; select your email account &gt; update the password field. Save the changes, and Thunderbird should now use your new password to access your email account. </p><p>Regards, TG </p>",techguy150,false,0,0

And some of it doesn't even apply to me.  </p><p>First, the Thunderbird window isn't hidden. It's empty. That's not the issue.  </p><p>Second, restarting Thunderbird is something I already tried, including after I'd renamed the xulstore.json file (which I mentioned I'd done). Obviously it didn't help.  </p><p>Third, disabling hardware acceleration cannot be done. As I initially reported, the Settings or Options are not available. They will not open, no matter what. So I'm literally incapable of trying that.  </p><p>Fourth, I renamed my Profiles folder as you suggested. Far from creating a new Profiles directory, Thunderbird instead threw an error: ""Your Thunderbird profile cannot be loaded. It may be missing or inaccessible"" with an OK button (see attached screenshot). Clicking that caused the message to go away. Thunderbird didn't create a new Profiles directory and it didn't open at all.  </p><p>So, as I said, thanks for trying, but I'm back to where I was with this. </p>",djhalnon,false,0,0

Here are some troubleshooting steps to try: </p><p>Check for a hidden window: Sometimes, Thunderbird may open but be positioned off-screen or minimized. Look for Thunderbird in the taskbar or system tray, right-click on it, and select ""Maximize"" or ""Restore"" to bring the window back into view. </p><p>Restart Thunderbird: Close Thunderbird completely and then relaunch it. Sometimes, a temporary glitch can cause the window to appear empty, and restarting the application can resolve the issue. </p><p>Disable hardware acceleration: Thunderbird uses hardware acceleration to enhance its performance, but it can sometimes cause display issues. To disable hardware acceleration, go to ""Tools"" (or ""Options"") &gt; ""Options"" &gt; ""Advanced"" &gt; ""General"" &gt; ""Config Editor."" Search for the preference ""gfx.direct2d.disabled"" and set it to ""true."" Restart Thunderbird and check if the window appears correctly. </p><p>Clear Thunderbird profile cache: The Thunderbird profile cache can sometimes become corrupted and cause display problems. To clear the cache, close Thunderbird completely, press ""Win + R"" to open the Run dialog, type ""%appdata%"" (without quotes), and press Enter. Locate the Thunderbird folder, open it, and find the ""Profiles"" folder. Rename the ""Profiles"" folder to ""Profiles.old"" to create a backup. Then, relaunch Thunderbird, and it will create a new profile. Check if the window is no longer empty. </p>",techguy150,false,0,0
