His solution was to go to  VIEW on the Instructions in the upper left and then to Layout and then to uncheck the MESSAGES which was checked in the lower part of the choices.  Viola, what I was complaining about was eliminated,  Obviously I cannot send you a copy of what was irritating me as it no longer exists.  Yay!  Thanks for following up, however.  It is much appreciated as I was totally incensed.  My Thunderbird site just had an update today and I presume that is why the Messages got checked again.  It is no longer. </p>",lois_stevens,false,0,0

Yes, the new email is noted to have arrived but it is still present on the bottom of the page and is hard to read when trying to manipulate it upwards to read the contents.  Yes, I want the new emails to be shown at the stop of the incoming emails, but when I open that email I want it to be opened on the total page not under the listing of the emails as it is now. </p>",lois_stevens,false,0,0

Da quel che leggo in giro, Mail salva i messaggi in file singoli, questo fa si che i backup incrementali possano essere limitati ai nuovi messaggi. Thunderbird invece usa un formato monolitico chiamato mbox in cui ogni cartella di Thunderbird corrisponde ad un singolo file su disco. La nuova posta vine salvata in coda ai file già esistenti che quindi risulteranno modificati e verranno salvati nuovamente in ogni backup. </p><p>Soluzioni? 1) Una possibile soluzione è quella di raccogliere i messaggi più vecchi in singole cartelle. Queste non venendo modificate ogni volta, dovrebbero funzionare bene anche in un backup incrementale. 2) Esiste anche la possibilità di impostare Thunderbird per salvare i messaggi in file singoli come spiegato qui  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/maildir-thunderbird"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/maildir-thunderbird</a> <strong>Ma è una funzione sperimentale, incompleta e con numerosi bug non risolti per cui ti sconsiglio di usarla</strong> </p>",@next,false,1,0
