I prepared the new PC for Thunderbird to avoid time loss. I succeeded to restart the old PC, but a session only lasts for about ten minutes, then a blue screen is slowly appearing line by line. This is not enough time to make a new backup, but it allows me to save individual files and folders. I thus exported my Thunderbird environment. Can I merge the exported data (a few K emails) with the new Thunderbird environment (a few hundred emails)? I will be much obliged if you can suggest a solution. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1588777;,rf.van.zijl
