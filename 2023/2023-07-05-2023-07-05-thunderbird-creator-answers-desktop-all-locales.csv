If I click to reply to an email, the reply is sent from the account it came from. Fine.  </p><p>If I click write to write a new email, it sends from the account that is currently highlighted.  This is causing me trouble, because I mostly only send emails from account 2. But sometimes I forget. Old age. And someone gets an email from an address they don't recognize.   </p><p>I don't know if there is a way to configure the default sending address, regardless of which account is currently highlighted.  </p><p>Is there a way to make that default to account two, or any particular account?
