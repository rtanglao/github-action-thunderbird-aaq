I believe I stumbled across this function several years ago, then it became lost to me and this time I couldn't find it. Perhaps it would be easier to find if it were given a separate label when right-clicking the folder so that one doesn't have to select ""properties"" before finding it. It wasn't intuitive to me to look for a ""repair"" function behind a ""properties"" function. Possibly, this function could also get a separate heading in the ""Help - more troubleshooting information"" top menu item? That is where I looked initially, and didn't find it. Thanks again!
