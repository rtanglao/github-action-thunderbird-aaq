When the form gives me the option of using my existing email address, does it mean the address I've been using with another service? I'm getting an alert that says: ""Unable to log in at server. Probably wrong configuration, username or password. </p><p>(2) I thought I was already logged in. However, the page I saw looked nothing at all like the page shown in ""Getting Started with the Thunderbird main window (Supernova and newer)."" (See attachment.) So the instructions in that article were of no use.  I clicked on ""Message"" in the toolbar at the top of the page, but the none of the items on the drop-down menu were highlighted. </p><p>In short, I'm completely at sea. I would like to try Thunderbird, but have no idea how to get started. I'm obviously doing something wrong. </p><p>Would anyone be willing to walk me through this? </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1590491;,mdennisburns

Some of the issues I've been having include: ~Thunderbird crashes for no apparent reason. ~Sometimes it re-downloads emails (old or new) in one or more POP &amp; IMAP email accounts.  Sometimes two copies of the same email are re-downloaded at once. ~Sometimes an attachment is corrupted and will not open or if it does some of it is missing or jumbled.  I have to re-download them from the provider's site.  The size of the attachment is the same whether it's corrupted or fine. ~Sometimes emails appear with no ""header"" information (Sender, Subject, Date etc) just a pile of garbled characters in the body. ~The RHS day's event view in calendar does not always update to the current date. </p><p>I have been using Thunderbird for over 15 years so my profile folder probably has a few files that may be corrupt or obsolete.  Is there any way to clean out the profile folder of all non required/old files or to ""repair"" it by overwriting some of the files.  Alternatively, can I move my current email accounts and local folders, contacts, calendar and filters to a new profile so as to have a ""clean"" start. </p><p>Thank you for your assistance! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1590458;,danno59
