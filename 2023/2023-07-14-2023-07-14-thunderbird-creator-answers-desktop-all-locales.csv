Sono passato alla Versione 115 di Thunderbird dalla 102 ed utilizzo il Lettore di Schermo Nvda. Come è possibile, ora, riordinare le Colonne in Thunderbird, quelle dove vi è lo Stato, ad esempio, quindi anche il Pulsante per Scegliere quali Colonne Visualizzare. Sino alla precedente versione, ciò si poteva fare, non agevolmente, usando la Navigazione ad Oggetti di Nvda, oppure con un Addon di Nvda, che ora non funziona più, ma quest'ultimo è un problema dello Sviluppatore del Componente, di cui attenderò Feedbacks. Nel frattempo, ho urgenza di poter riordinare le Colonne, giacchè la voce ""Non letto"" mi viene letta immediatamente prima dell'oggetto, a me interessa avere invece prima l'Oggetto e poi il ""Non letto"", dunque dovrei scambiarle. Inoltre, quando un messaggio è stato letto, viene detto 2 volte dalla sintesi, siccome avevo nelle versioni precedenti, anche lo ""Stato"" attivato. Spero di essermi spiegato e resto a disposizione per collaborare, al meglio delle mie possibilità! Grazie a tutti! </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,it,"",barramaurizio68

Some of the issues I've been having include: ~Thunderbird crashes for no apparent reason. ~Sometimes it re-downloads emails (old or new) in one or more POP &amp; IMAP email accounts.  Sometimes two copies of the same email are re-downloaded at once. ~Sometimes an attachment is corrupted and will not open or if it does some of it is missing or jumbled.  I have to re-download them from the provider's site.  The size of the attachment is the same whether it's corrupted or fine. ~Sometimes emails appear with no ""header"" information (Sender, Subject, Date etc) just a pile of garbled characters in the body. ~The RHS day's event view in calendar does not always update to the current date. </p><p>I have been using Thunderbird for over 15 years so my profile folder probably has a few files that may be corrupt or obsolete.  Is there any way to clean out the profile folder of all non required/old files or to ""repair"" it by overwriting some of the files.  Alternatively, can I move my current email accounts and local folders, contacts, calendar and filters to a new profile so as to have a ""clean"" start. </p><p>Thank you for your assistance! </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1590458;1590522;,danno59
