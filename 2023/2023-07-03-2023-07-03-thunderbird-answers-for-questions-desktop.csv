Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem: </p><p>Enable IMAP in your Microsoft 365 account: By default, Microsoft 365 Outlook uses the Exchange protocol, which is not natively supported by Thunderbird. However, you can enable IMAP access in your Microsoft 365 account settings. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account through a web browser, go to the account settings or options, and enable IMAP. Make a note of the IMAP server settings provided by Microsoft. </p><p>Configure Thunderbird for Microsoft 365 Outlook using IMAP: Open Thunderbird and go to ""Tools"" (or ""Options"") &gt; ""Account Settings"". Click on ""Account Actions"" and select ""Add Mail Account"". Enter your name, email address, and the password associated with your Microsoft 365 Outlook account. Click on ""Continue"". Thunderbird should automatically detect the server settings based on your email address. If not, choose ""Manual config"" and enter the IMAP server settings provided by Microsoft. Click on ""Done"" to complete the configuration. </p>",techguy150,false,0,1

So if you can still get access to webmail account and change passwords then I doubt if your account has been hacked. </p><p>Maybe you got a mailor daemon email saying an email could not be delivered, but you never sent it. You got that email because the real sender pretended to be you and entered your email address so if the TO email address did not exist then you got the bounce back.  To be honest that was actually very helpful for you because it means you know someone was sending emails using your email address. So, it would be a good idea to let all your family and friends know what has been occuring just in case they also received an email reportedly from you containing something which could cause damage. Suggest you also state you are always going to use a specific signature, so recipients will know it really is from you.  In these cases, the abuser gets bored with your email address if it does not get the reponse they are looking for and stops abusing it. </p><p>Sometimes spammers are a real pain in the proverbial. They enter your name as the display name in the email address because it often gets around junk filters in email clients.  Sometimes they enter your email address so it looks like it was From you and the purpose is to avoid spam filters.  The spammers/hoaxers really are trying to get into your Inbox and then they usually try to trigger your curiousity with the content or attachment. Do not be conned into responding or clicking on anything in the email or trying to open any attachments.  </p><p>If you are really concerned if they have somehow got your 'password' which is not the same as abusing an email address, then do the following: </p><p>Exit all programs. Start computer in 'Safe Mode'  (not Safe mode with Networking) Run full scans. This scan will detect if there are any unwanted keylogger programs running which provide info about what keys you press on keyboard - eg: passwords. It should auto fix these issues if they are present. If anything comes back saying there is an issue in Thunderbird profile maybe an email, do not let it do an auto fix as it might cause a bigger problem deleting a load of emails. Just make a note of the problem file info. It's much better to locate and delete the email within Thunderbird and then compact the folder to really get rid all deleted data. </p><p>Once you know your computer is ok, I think you can assume you resetting a password is also ok. However, If something - virus - trojan - keylogger etc is detected and gets fixed. After it is fixed, restart Computer and immediately update password in webmail and then in Thunderbird. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

It will come to the fore. </p><p>A lot depends on your sizing of your windows. You'll have little annoyances to cope with if you insist on running programs in full-screen mode.

It first started with a message from Virgin saying that emails would be unavailable for a few hours overnight so I put it down to that. After speaking to Virgin they assure me that there is no problem in my area now. Using Virgin's web-mail all the latest emails are there but they won't come down in TB I sent a test message off my wife's tablet last night and iy showed up but nothing today, just the little dot flashing back and forth top left </p>",dj.eardley,false,0,0

Te ne accorgeresti però anche navigando di problemi del genere. - Problemi al server: è di solito il motivo più comune: se il server è sovraccarico o tarda molto a rispondere alle richieste di Thunderbird (generando un errore di 'tempo scaduto') oppure chiude le connessioni che non riesce a gestire con l'errore di disconnessione che hai mostrato sopra. Purtroppo a poterti rispondere in merito è solo il tuo fornitore. </p><p>Questo tipo di problemi sono più frequenti con le connessioni IMAP in cui il client rimane costantemente collegato al server. Se non hai bisogno di IMAP, potresti passare a POP3 che si connette in maniera differente e solo a certi intervalli di tempo.
