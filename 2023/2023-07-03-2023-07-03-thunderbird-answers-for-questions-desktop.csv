It sends your request to server and then waits for a reply. You might verify with Virgin that the recommended email settings have not changed. </p>,davidsk,false,0,0

When I try to download emails I get ""connection to imap/virginmedia timed out"" I get occasional emails coming through but not as many as I would normally expect. I've done the usual re-booting etc. Ive even deleted Thunderbird altogether (saved the profile file) and reinstalled. It first started with a message from Virgin saying that emails would be unavailable for a few hours overnight so I put it down to that. After speaking to Virgin they assure me that there is no problem in my area now. Using Virgin's web-mail all the latest emails are there but they won't come down in TB I sent a test message off my wife's tablet last night and iy showed up but nothing today, just the little dot flashing back and forth top left </p>",dj.eardley,false,0,0

Otherwise, the profile will likely be corrupt. Second, try letting Thunderbird do the work. Try tools&gt;import&gt;import from another installation. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
