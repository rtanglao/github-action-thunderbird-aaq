Or was ""Agent"" your email client (software), and your server (provider) an IMAP server? </p><p>If Agent only supported POP, how did it happen to have copies of your messages available? </p><p>And the big question: Why in the world would you move perfectly good messages from a secure folder on your computer INTO an IMAP-connected INBOX, when the IMAP server is only prepared to have messages in your INBOX that originated from the current server? </p><p>I'm just plain confused, and hoping to get some clarification from you. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

Have you tried clicking the two-box icon just to the left of the X at the top right of your window, and then moving the edges of the reduced-size window to try to see the Reply window behind it? </p><p>Another idea occurred to me: With your main window open and a message selected, click the Reply button, and then if the Reply window is not right in front, minimize the main window by clicking the dash at the top of the window, to the left of the Full-screen/restored-size button. That will reveal any window that's hiding behind your main window. </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

It will come to the fore. </p><p>A lot depends on your sizing of your windows. You'll have little annoyances to cope with if you insist on running programs in full-screen mode. Make your TBird window occupy a smaller portion of your screen, and then click Reply, and make your Reply window occupy a slightly larger portion of your screen than the main window. </p><p>That'll do it. </p><p>Another trick you can use (when you have a window open and then you open another window that comes to the front) is press the Alt key and tap the Tab key. That'll switch the rear to the front and the front to the rear, and doing it again will do it again. &lt;smile&gt; </p>",danawilson001,false,0,0

When I try to download emails I get ""connection to imap/virginmedia timed out"" I get occasional emails coming through but not as many as I would normally expect. I've done the usual re-booting etc. Ive even deleted Thunderbird altogether (saved the profile file) and reinstalled. It first started with a message from Virgin saying that emails would be unavailable for a few hours overnight so I put it down to that. After speaking to Virgin they assure me that there is no problem in my area now. Using Virgin's web-mail all the latest emails are there but they won't come down in TB I sent a test message off my wife's tablet last night and iy showed up but nothing today, just the little dot flashing back and forth top left </p>",dj.eardley,false,0,0

Te ne accorgeresti però anche navigando di problemi del genere. - Problemi al server: è di solito il motivo più comune: se il server è sovraccarico o tarda molto a rispondere alle richieste di Thunderbird (generando un errore di 'tempo scaduto') oppure chiude le connessioni che non riesce a gestire con l'errore di disconnessione che hai mostrato sopra. Purtroppo a poterti rispondere in merito è solo il tuo fornitore. </p><p>Questo tipo di problemi sono più frequenti con le connessioni IMAP in cui il client rimane costantemente collegato al server. Se non hai bisogno di IMAP, potresti passare a POP3 che si connette in maniera differente e solo a certi intervalli di tempo.
