Thunderbird may not display clickable hyperlinks in plain text mode. You can switch between HTML and plain text views by going to the ""View"" menu and selecting ""Message Body As"" &gt; ""Original HTML"" or ""Simple HTML."" </p><p>Verify Thunderbird settings: Check your Thunderbird settings to make sure hyperlinks are enabled. To do this, go to Thunderbird's main menu, select ""Tools,"" and choose ""Options"" (or ""Preferences"" on macOS). In the Options/Preferences window, select the ""Display"" tab and make sure the ""Allow remote content in messages"" option is checked. This allows Thunderbird to display hyperlinks correctly. </p><p>Disable add-ons or extensions: Certain add-ons or extensions in Thunderbird can interfere with the display of hyperlinks. Try disabling any add-ons or extensions you have installed and see if the issue persists. To disable add-ons, go to the main menu, select ""Tools,"" and choose ""Add-ons."" Disable any extensions and restart Thunderbird. </p><p>Update Thunderbird: Make sure you have the latest version of Thunderbird installed. Outdated versions may have bugs or compatibility issues that could affect the display of hyperlinks. You can check for updates by going to the main menu, selecting ""Help,"" and choosing ""About Thunderbird."" If an update is available, follow the prompts to install it. </p><p>Check antivirus or firewall settings: Some antivirus programs or firewall settings can interfere with Thunderbird's ability to display hyperlinks.

To do this, go to Thunderbird's main menu, select ""Tools,"" and choose ""Account Settings."" In the Account Settings window, select the email account experiencing the issue and click on the ""Server Settings"" category. Ensure that the SMTP server hostname, port number, and connection security settings match the requirements of your email provider.

In the same ""Server Settings"" section as mentioned above, check the ""Authentication method"" dropdown menu. Depending on your email provider, you may need to use options like ""Password, Normal,"" ""OAuth2,"" or ""TLS Certificate"" for authentication. Again, referring to your email provider's instructions can help determine the appropriate authentication method to use. </p>",techguy150,false,0,0
