Thunderbird may not display clickable hyperlinks in plain text mode. You can switch between HTML and plain text views by going to the ""View"" menu and selecting ""Message Body As"" &gt; ""Original HTML"" or ""Simple HTML."" </p><p>Verify Thunderbird settings: Check your Thunderbird settings to make sure hyperlinks are enabled. To do this, go to Thunderbird's main menu, select ""Tools,"" and choose ""Options"" (or ""Preferences"" on macOS). In the Options/Preferences window, select the ""Display"" tab and make sure the ""Allow remote content in messages"" option is checked. This allows Thunderbird to display hyperlinks correctly. </p><p>Disable add-ons or extensions: Certain add-ons or extensions in Thunderbird can interfere with the display of hyperlinks. Try disabling any add-ons or extensions you have installed and see if the issue persists. To disable add-ons, go to the main menu, select ""Tools,"" and choose ""Add-ons."" Disable any extensions and restart Thunderbird. </p><p>Update Thunderbird: Make sure you have the latest version of Thunderbird installed. Outdated versions may have bugs or compatibility issues that could affect the display of hyperlinks. You can check for updates by going to the main menu, selecting ""Help,"" and choosing ""About Thunderbird."" If an update is available, follow the prompts to install it. </p><p>Check antivirus or firewall settings: Some antivirus programs or firewall settings can interfere with Thunderbird's ability to display hyperlinks. Temporarily disable any antivirus software or adjust firewall settings and see if that resolves the issue. </p>",techguy150,false,0,0

That folder is administered by Gmail and contains all messages. You do not need it in THunderbird and it can be obviously confusing. On the other issue, check to see if you're viewing mail as 'unified folders.' That is a setting that causes all accounts to appear as one. You can check that by clicking view&gt;folders and see if 'unified folders' is checked. If that isn't the cause, then more information will be needed. Let us know. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

There is no known limit to my knowledge of the number of accounts that TB can manage. If you want to remove the passwords stored by TB, you can do that by these steps:  - go to settings&gt;Privacy&amp;security - click 'saved passwords' and then 'show passwords'  - highlight both rows for your account and delete them  That removes passwords so you can then use the passwords for account.
