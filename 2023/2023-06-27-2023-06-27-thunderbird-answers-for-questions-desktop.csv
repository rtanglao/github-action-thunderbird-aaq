Basically some nefarious person is abusing your email address, but it does not necessarilly mean you've been hacked. Never respond to them.  If it's a bounce back email saying it attempted to send to someone you've never heard of then it would be wise to let family and friends be aware of the problem and perhaps tell them if email is really from you then it will have a specific signature which is unique to you. They usually give up in the end if they get nothing from it. Sometimes spammers try to use it just so it gets around the spam filters - so it looks like you send email to yourself - very annoying. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Disable any extensions and restart Thunderbird. </p><p>Update Thunderbird: Make sure you have the latest version of Thunderbird installed. Outdated versions may have bugs or compatibility issues that could affect the display of hyperlinks. You can check for updates by going to the main menu, selecting ""Help,"" and choosing ""About Thunderbird."" If an update is available, follow the prompts to install it. </p><p>Check antivirus or firewall settings: Some antivirus programs or firewall settings can interfere with Thunderbird's ability to display hyperlinks.
