The first import works fine, but the second one doesn't. Both are created with the same script, which is using the same ca. It creates the key and the csr, signs it with the CA and put it in the p12 file. So the both differ only in the used email and the cert/key. I've tried it with the cert containing the full chain and without. No success. It's not possible for me to import it. Is there any point in thurderbird which breaks the import? A good reason I don't see??&nbsp;:) </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",me365

For two of these (ultimately the same host but two different email addresses) I have a problem with certificates. Every so often I notice that nothing is being picked up from those accounts. If I explicitly click ""Get messages"" for those accounts I get a certificate exception, tell Thunderbird to accept the exception and then it will pull mail from those accounts for the next several days/weeks. I assume at some point the exception times out or something changes with the email host after a while and Thunderbird stops pulling in mail for those accounts again. It's frustrating that I have to notice there is no mail coming from those accounts so I can do the ""Get messages"" bit to deal with the exception. </p><p>I would like to either find a set up where accepting the exception lasts for ever once I've said it's fine; </p><p>OR  </p><p>I would like to have the certificate error message come up if Thunderbird has a problem with those accounts during normal daily start-up it when I start up. It just seems odd that the error isn't reported during normal start-up but is reported if I click ""get messages"".  </p><p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions made. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",suzie3
