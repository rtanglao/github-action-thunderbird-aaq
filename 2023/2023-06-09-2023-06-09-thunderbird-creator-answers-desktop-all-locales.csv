Even if I have marked them with a star this doesn't help them to be visible in my inbox. Instead I am having to guess at a suitable search term to find these messages (often support from Email addresses I do not normally correspond with). I realise I can (in theory) switch threading off (although this didn't seem to actually work for me), but I otherwise like the feature - once I have found the message, it's great to see the thread. </p><p>I would like to be able to show threads in a different colour to make them stand out in my mailbox - I realise there is a small grey symbol against threads, but this isn't very visible and doesn't seem to help. </p><p>One other possibility that might be even better, is to expand threads with unread messages, but I couldn't see a way to do this either. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",robin_penny

Szeretném látni az összes levelemet, érkezési sorrendben, egymás alatt, mint eddig. Új email fiókot vettem fel a programba és itt rendezi a leveleimet, a régebben használt email fiókomnál ezt nem teszi és ezt szeretném az újonnan ""regisztráltnál"" is beállítani, de nem sikerül. Van olyan levelem, amit nem is látok, nem jelenik meg sehol, egyik ""témában"" sem, csak jelzi, hogy van egy új levelem. Lehet valahol törölni ezt a funkciót? </p><p>Köszönettel: Dr. Karcsú Noémi </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,hu,1584645;,karcsudoki

The first import works fine, but the second one doesn't. Both are created with the same script, which is using the same ca. It creates the key and the csr, signs it with the CA and put it in the p12 file. So the both differ only in the used email and the cert/key. I've tried it with the cert containing the full chain and without. No success. It's not possible for me to import it. Is there any point in thurderbird which breaks the import?

For two of these (ultimately the same host but two different email addresses) I have a problem with certificates. Every so often I notice that nothing is being picked up from those accounts. If I explicitly click ""Get messages"" for those accounts I get a certificate exception, tell Thunderbird to accept the exception and then it will pull mail from those accounts for the next several days/weeks. I assume at some point the exception times out or something changes with the email host after a while and Thunderbird stops pulling in mail for those accounts again. It's frustrating that I have to notice there is no mail coming from those accounts so I can do the ""Get messages"" bit to deal with the exception. </p><p>I would like to either find a set up where accepting the exception lasts for ever once I've said it's fine; </p><p>OR  </p><p>I would like to have the certificate error message come up if Thunderbird has a problem with those accounts during normal daily start-up it when I start up.
