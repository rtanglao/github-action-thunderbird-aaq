I created a ""Default Identity"" and put in my first and last name in the ""Your Name"" section. When I send emails, however, the recipient only sees my first name and email address in the ""From"" line. I would like them to see my first and last name and not to see the email address in the ""From"" line. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",admin688

For two of these (ultimately the same host but two different email addresses) I have a problem with certificates. Every so often I notice that nothing is being picked up from those accounts. If I explicitly click ""Get messages"" for those accounts I get a certificate exception, tell Thunderbird to accept the exception and then it will pull mail from those accounts for the next several days/weeks. I assume at some point the exception times out or something changes with the email host after a while and Thunderbird stops pulling in mail for those accounts again. It's frustrating that I have to notice there is no mail coming from those accounts so I can do the ""Get messages"" bit to deal with the exception. </p><p>I would like to either find a set up where accepting the exception lasts for ever once I've said it's fine; </p><p>OR  </p><p>I would like to have the certificate error message come up if Thunderbird has a problem with those accounts during normal daily start-up it when I start up. It just seems odd that the error isn't reported during normal start-up but is reported if I click ""get messages"".  </p><p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions made. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",suzie3

Both have Thunderbird set up exactly the same to the best of my knowledge.  One of them has a dropdown box with Local Folders next to Inbox, Drafts, Sent, Archives, and Junk as seen in the attached photo.  The second looks exactly the same but there are no dropdown boxes next to Inbox, Drafts, Sent, Archives, and Junk.  Is there a way I can remove these dropdown boxes from my Thunderbird interface on the one computer?  </p><p>Thank you, Steve </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1584618;1584619;,rino1222
