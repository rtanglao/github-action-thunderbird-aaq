I also have moved many emails from the inbox to folders I have created,   For instance  there is a folder 'Brighton Phil' on my old thunderbird.  In it I have placed all the emails relating to the Brighton Philatelic Society [I am a stamp collector].  In the old thunderbird the 'brighton phil' folder is a subfolder of Inbox which is the first item under the 'Local Folders' section .  You can see this on the last photo I sent you.   Thanks for the tip on the  'snapshot' utility.  I use PrtScr but it is generally not possible for many programs to attach these images.   Definitely going to bed now. </p>",info9493,false,0,0

Since your account is IMAP, the full account is already there. For your addressbook, I suggest tools&gt;import&gt;import from a file&gt;import addressbook&gt;sqlite   and then select the abook.sqlite file on USBstick. That should salvage the addressbook. Now, if all is working, identify which folders, if any, are needed. TIP: go to this URL:  bluefive dot pair dot com and there is a FREE screenshot utility called 'snapshot' that does an excellent job of capturing part of the PC screen, should you ever need to do screenshots again. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I can fit only 21 in one photo so will attach the first three photo 117 is the first 20 items on the usb, 118 is the second 20 items and 119 is the next 20 items. there once agin many files in the thunderbird profile on the new machine.
