But then, why does TB ""encourage"" or ""suggest"" we use IMAP? i.e. When we first set up TB, the instructions say ""we suggest IMAP"". That only makes extra work. So now I have to go through all the work with 3 different gmail accounts to do this. And the instructions are not clear about:&nbsp;??? Do we create the new POP accounts first, and have 6? And then delete the IMAP accounts? Does that insure that we won't lose any messages that we have on TB? And after we do delete a message from TB, does that mean it's never ever going to be retrieved from gmail should we make a mistake? A question about the Bottom line? If we re-create all accounts to POP. Then, when we download a message from gmail to TB, it disappears from online gmail? And the only place it will remain is on TB? That's not what I want. I want my messages to stay on gmail. Just not keep downloading every time I open TB. Today, I opened TB, downloaded messages from Gmail. And my inbox showed over 700 messages, with about 44 unread and the remaining in grey as ""read"". I then deleted those 654 unread. And when I downloaded for NEW messages, I got all 700 plus again. My point is that when I delete a message from TB, I want it gone from TB. I don't care one way or another about gmail. Gmail can keep thousands of messages, I don't care what they do. I can go online and delete them. But when I do, it takes forever because gmail don't allow you so sort the read from the unread like TB does. So apparently the problem is with gmail and not TB. But everyone knows how easy it is to get gmail to tell me what to fix. Can someone here with TB tell me what to do online with gmail? What steps? Or is there a video on YouTube? Those I can usually follow. </p>",PennsyNut,false,0,0
