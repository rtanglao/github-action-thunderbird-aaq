Manejo Thunderbird Mail desde 2006 y en MACOS desde 2009, como conservo mucho el correo tengo dividido en perfiles. Hace unos días decidí eliminar uno de los perfiles y ocurrió que se borraron todos los perfiles todo el contenido de la carpeta desapareció, con una APP de recuperación pude ver que los archivos XXXXX.default seguían en su sitio, por razones de trabajo deje esta recuperación para mas tarde, pasados unos días los archivos ya no aparecen. 1… Están en el sistema y debo de buscar alguna aplicación de recuperación para salvarlos. 2…Ya se han eliminado directamente. 3…Están en otra carpeta diferente /User/Library/Thunderbird Sería bueno ver de que manera no pueda volver a ocurrir.

Also just logging in in Google in Firefox with the username and the password of the remote address book works fine and I can see all the contacts.

What I see is an empty window. Well, not entirely empty; it shows the menu bar, some of the toolbar buttons, and lines for the different panes of the Thunderbird window. But, there's nothing inside any of them.  </p><p>Also, many of the menu functions are disabled or grayed out. Two that aren't, are Tools &gt; Settings and Tools &gt; Account Settings, but clicking either of those does nothing. The three-line menu near the top-right also does nothing if I click on it.  </p><p>See attached screenshot of what this is all about.  </p><p>I've seen a few different solutions online. One is to delete the xulstore.json file in my Thunderbird profile directory. I did that (to be more precise, I renamed that file to xulstore.json.save). Didn't help.  </p><p>I also saw mention of somehow moving a profile between two different computers, which I don't think has anything to do with this situation. I have no idea what to do with that suggestion.  </p><p>I saw something about ""about:profiles"" which I have no idea how to pull up (I tried entering it into the bars at the top of the Thunderbird window and hitting Enter; nothing happened).  </p><p>About the only thing that even attempts to work at all, is Help &gt; Troubleshoot Mode, which I tried. And guess what; although it did restart Thunderbird in troubleshooting mode, that didn't help, either. Still the big empty window with 99% of functionality gone.  </p><p>I don't see an item in Help menu called ""Troubleshooting Information,"" but I do see ""More Troubleshooting Information."" Clicking on that also (guess what?) does nothing.  </p><p>Thunderbird's entry in Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features doesn't offer any ""repair"" option, so that's yet another dead end.  </p><p>Any ideas appreciated. But offhand it sure looks as though I'm SOL with Thunderbird. Guess I'll have to find a new email client, one that will actually, like, work. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1588492;1588517;,djhalnon
