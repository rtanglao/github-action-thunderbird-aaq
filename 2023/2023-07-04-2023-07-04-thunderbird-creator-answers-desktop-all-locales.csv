What I see is an empty window. Well, not entirely empty; it shows the menu bar, some of the toolbar buttons, and lines for the different panes of the Thunderbird window. But, there's nothing inside any of them.  </p><p>Also, many of the menu functions are disabled or grayed out. Two that aren't, are Tools &gt; Settings and Tools &gt; Account Settings, but clicking either of those does nothing. The three-line menu near the top-right also does nothing if I click on it.  </p><p>See attached screenshot of what this is all about.  </p><p>I've seen a few different solutions online. One is to delete the xulstore.json file in my Thunderbird profile directory. I did that (to be more precise, I renamed that file to xulstore.json.save). Didn't help.  </p><p>I also saw mention of somehow moving a profile between two different computers, which I don't think has anything to do with this situation. I have no idea what to do with that suggestion.  </p><p>I saw something about ""about:profiles"" which I have no idea how to pull up (I tried entering it into the bars at the top of the Thunderbird window and hitting Enter; nothing happened).  </p><p>About the only thing that even attempts to work at all, is Help &gt; Troubleshoot Mode, which I tried. And guess what; although it did restart Thunderbird in troubleshooting mode, that didn't help, either. Still the big empty window with 99% of functionality gone.  </p><p>I don't see an item in Help menu called ""Troubleshooting Information,"" but I do see ""More Troubleshooting Information."" Clicking on that also (guess what?) does nothing.  </p><p>Thunderbird's entry in Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features doesn't offer any ""repair"" option, so that's yet another dead end.  </p><p>Any ideas appreciated. But offhand it sure looks as though I'm SOL with Thunderbird. Guess I'll have to find a new email client, one that will actually, like, work. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",djhalnon
