After an indeterminate period of time, Thunderbird just seems to stop being able to copy messages to the sent folder.  It starts giving a server timeout message.  I've tried making sure I'm subscribed to the Sent folder, using a different folder, creating a new folder and using that.  None of it works.  All that seems to work is uninstalling Thunderbird, deleting the profile folder, and starting again. </p><p>I went through the delete, scrub, reinstall process today and it worked for maybe 20 or 40 emails, then BORK. </p><p>Any ideas?  The only think I can think of that I have done sooner this time around is add in my Google calendars to Thunderbird. </p><p>I love TB,  but this is driving me nuts.  I have to keep reinstalling on my desktop and laptop. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",mark468

I still have my emails on my IMAP server.  How do I re-download the emails from my IMAP server even though Tbird already downloaded them once? I set my IMAP emails to unread and that didn't work.  What setting in Thunderbird will allow downloading of my IMAP emails again?  Is there a cache or something I need to clear to do this?  Thank you.

I don't do any folder sorting; I just keep messages in ""inbox"" until I archive it. I don't have any plugins. I don't have any identities other than what is made with each account. I am updated to the latest TB version, 102.12.0 (64-bit). </p><p><br> PROBLEM: </p> <ol><li>1: </li></ol> <p>I send an email from personal@gmail.moc to contact@mybusiness.moc. The message eventually arrives in the inbox of business@gmail.moc. When I reply to this message (reply or reply all), a compose window opens with: From = personal@gmail.moc To = contact@mybusiness.moc </p><p>These should be: From = business@gmail.moc To = personal@gmail.moc </p><p>I get the expected behavior when: I send from someone else's account external@gmail.moc to my contact@mybusiness.moc. I send from personal@gmail.moc to business@gmail.moc. (This result is important.) </p><p><br> </p> <ol><li>2: </li></ol> <p>I get a similar problem when I send an email from personal@gmail.moc to oldaddress@gmail.moc. I eventually get the message at bills@gmail.moc. When I click reply, the compose window shows: From = personal@gmail.moc To = oldaddress@gmail.moc </p><p>These should be: From = bills@gmail.moc To = personal@gmail.moc </p><p><br> DISCUSSION: It seems that when a message is forwarded to another address AND Thunderbird has BOTH the originator account and the recipient account, a reply to that message picks up the wrong FROM and TO fields. When testing this setup, I initially thought the problem was more widespread affecting external accounts too but now I see that it is only if the same instance of TB has both accounts. I suppose as it is, this isn't a big problem as I don't actually send messages to myself. I only did this for testing and it confused me for a while. </p><p>I have seen a couple other posts mention this problem. The suggested solution is to configure identities but this /has/ to be a bug that should be resolved. It doesn't make sense that it would work like this. </p><p><br> RELATED: Errors populating To, From, and Reply-To fields on replies <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1239772"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1239772</a> </p><p>How can I reply to the sender instead of replying to my alias I got the email from? <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1370144"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1370144</a> </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",eq578293
