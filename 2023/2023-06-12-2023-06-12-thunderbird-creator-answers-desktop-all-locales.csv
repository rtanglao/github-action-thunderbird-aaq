When testing this setup, I initially thought the problem was more widespread affecting external accounts too but now I see that it is only if the same instance of TB has both accounts. I suppose as it is, this isn't a big problem as I don't actually send messages to myself. I only did this for testing and it confused me for a while. </p><p>I have seen a couple other posts mention this problem.
