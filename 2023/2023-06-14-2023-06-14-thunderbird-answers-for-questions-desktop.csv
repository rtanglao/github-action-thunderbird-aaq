Instead, you must selective identify the desired folders and that must be done outside of Thunderbird. Those profiles you have may go back a long time, as Thunderbird never uses more than one. New profiles are automatically created whenever Thunderbird starts and does not 'see' an active profile. Each profile has a Mail folder and in each Mail folder are POP account folders, which each contain folders of messages. Also, each Mail folder has a Local Folders folder and there may be message folders there as well. Your challenge is to identify all of them, rename as appropriate to avoid duplication, and copy to the Mail\Local Folders folder of your active profile. That preserves all of your POP mail in local folders. You are now free to create all the missing accounts. After verifying that all is working, you can delete the other profiles.  </p><p>One more thing: each profile as an addressbook named abook.sqlite. I suggest locating the largest or most recent and also copy that into the active profile. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

My suggestion is to browse the profiles in Windows file explorer to determine which have content. For example, the addressbook is abook.sqlite, and any POP accounts will be in the Mail folder, as well as any Local folders. Any IMAP accounts would be defined in the Imapmail folder. Once you know that, and the last date that folders were updated in each, you will have a better perspective on the value of each profile. For addressbook, I would search for the biggest and most recently updated one, as the tools&gt;import feature can import it into a desired new profile. If there are POP accounts, the folders in Mail\&lt;accountname&gt; can be copied into the new profile's Mail\Local folders folder (being appropriately renamed). </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
