ALL my emails (>1000s) from my other email providers AGAIN?,<p>Please excuse my unfamiliarity with the technical vocabulary. </p><p>Earlier this year I switched on Thunderbird to see what new emails had arrived. It started downloading ALL my emails from two of the five email accounts I have. I have a lot of emails as the accounts date from 2010. </p><p>Because I was concerned that I might exceed limits on the number of emails I can store on Thunderbird I spent hours going through the different folders and deleting as many of the duplicates as I could. </p><p>I switched on Thunderbird today and saw that the same process was happening again. In the time it took me to click on 'Work Offline' it had downloaded 263 emails I already have! </p><p>I would be very grateful if someone could tell me:  </p><p>How can I stop it downloading the hundreds of other old emails? How can I stop this process ever happening again? Why is it happening at all? </p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read my request. </p><p>For obvious reasons I have unticked the 'Email me when someone answers the thread' so I may be a little slow in acknowledging any responses. </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mr.blood

The password is correct and still current as verified by opening my xfinity account directly. This has been happening sporadically and randomly (correcting itself sporadically and randomly) for many months and for several updates. I have tried all the suggestions posted on this forum for other victims, but none of them have been successful for me. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",3077322115
