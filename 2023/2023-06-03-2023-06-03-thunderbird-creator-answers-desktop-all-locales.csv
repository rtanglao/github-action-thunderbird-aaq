Somehow the one message went to an email account that does not exist.   I went 12 days unable to send mail and somehow tonight it was fixed.  I have to think there was a patch made that solved the problem.  But yes, I did repeated messaged hoping for an answer.  I am sorry someone was offended but I was desperate and got NO answers to my email address.  As a Mozilla/thunderbird supporter I am disappointed. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1583690;,lorilohman
