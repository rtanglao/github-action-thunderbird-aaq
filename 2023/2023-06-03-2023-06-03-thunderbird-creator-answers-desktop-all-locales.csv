Somehow the one message went to an email account that does not exist.   I went 12 days unable to send mail and somehow tonight it was fixed.  I have to think there was a patch made that solved the problem.  But yes, I did repeated messaged hoping for an answer.  I am sorry someone was offended but I was desperate and got NO answers to my email address.  As a Mozilla/thunderbird supporter I am disappointed. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",lorilohman

They all turn to ""part 1.1"" or 1.2 from a jpg or png, etc.  I have to open them on my server, then save them to my computer without sending them to my PC. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",pj42
