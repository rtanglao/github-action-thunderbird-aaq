So I can't open TB because it can't locate my profile. I can't find any backups that have the profile folder included. I do however have the same data and profile on my Android phone and can read/write from there normally. This virtually is a copy of what I had on the PC (folders and sub folders etc). My question: Is there a way to copy the profile from my phone across to the PC (even if that means downloading thousands of messages)? </p><p>Your help would be very much appreciated. </p>,other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1583718;,13pgus

The profile folder, which-- to add confusion to peasants like me, the name is now XXXX.release-default-- but that is not my question.  I noticed that the profile folder was HUGE (13 gb!!), and when I looked inside I found that under ImapMail there are FOUR different folders: <a href=""http://Imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Imap.gmail.com</a>-1, <a href=""http://Imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Imap.gmail.com</a>-2, <a href=""http://Imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Imap.gmail.com</a>-3, <a href=""http://Imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Imap.gmail.com</a>-4, each with approx. 2 gb or more.  What is going on?  In TB 78 the corresponding folder (with mail from many years) was approx. 4 gb. </p><pre>  Please explain-- I like using TB, but it is a constant struggle for no good reason that I can discern. </pre>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",faure212

I don't use any ESET product myself, but I have to retrieve mail from a an Exchange-mailserver that requires ESET 2FA. The first login step seems to work, and then an ESET-authentication window pops up but the contents of the window remains blanc, so there is no way to enter my one-time code. This happens both if I approach the mailserver as an Exchange server, and if I approach the mail server through the OWA-protocol (using Owl). Known problem? Any suggestions? Should this be an issue for Thunderbird or for ESET? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",e.r.savelsbergh

I wanted to keep using Thunderbird and while I accept POP is gone, I wanted to maintain access to my old, downloaded emails as they form a useful database of information.  I've done this by disabling the server connections of the old POP accounts but leaving accounts themselves in Thunderbird and adding my new web-based account (Protonmail) to download current emails into Thunderbird.  All this has been accomplished successfully and works well. </p><p>It did take a wee bit of work to get all this 'successful and working well' and during the process Thunderbird has somehow managed to duplicate several folders that can not be deleted.  They are all empty except for the ones with the &gt; beside them and those contain the expected material that should be there (so are the ones I want to keep.)  Any way of getting rid of all these duplications, especially in Local Folders? They don't seem to be hurting anything but I find them annoying. </p><p>I'm on a Mac desktop with Ventura 13.3.1 </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",skyreburn
