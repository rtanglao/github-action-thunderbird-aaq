How?,"<p>Hi, </p><p>I just want to start Thunderbird offline and open existing messages as .eml files. </p><p>It seems to be impossible to create a mail folder view without a entering a mail account. </p><p>Why is this so difficult and what's the best way to hack Thunderbird into performing this seemingly trivial task? </p><p>I use Linux. </p><p>Ps: I've managed to start Thunderbird in offline mode, as per instructions here: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1364783"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1364783</a> </p><p>There seems to be some way to do this by mungeing 'Local Folders' but seems to trigger infinite recursion and other bugs..  Ideally, for my use case, Thunderbird should not try to import the messages, simply allow me to view them.  I want to use it as a viewer, not an agent. </p><p>Still experimenting.  I'll update if I have a breakthru. </p><p><br> </p><p>Cheers, Raro </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1590631;1590632;1590636;,firefox.raro
