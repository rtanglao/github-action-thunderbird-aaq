However, I can't see that there is any problem with the extension - it seems to me it is the website that is wrongly set up or the Addons Manager is faulty. The fact that the Manager failed in both our cases, it works  just fine via Google, which might well suggest a problem with the Manager. In some cases, although searching from the Add-ons Manager appears to give correct results. it shows extensions which are not compatible with 102.11. This actually could be the fault of the extensions but as more than one from different authors have problems it is more likely that the site (or its operators) is not sorting them into version correct types. I doubt the authors have control over this.  For example, a search from within the Manager for ""calendar"" gives a page with ""Google Calendar Tab"" and ""Open Google Calendar "" on it. Albeit similar, but apparently from different authors, neither of them work correctly with my version of 102.11 so it appears likely they are the wrong version. Even if the fault lies with the authors, I thought that extensions were supposed to be checked before they were allowed on the site - they used to be, anyway.

I tried several and they either failed because the Add-0n manager would not accept them or because they were broken. The latter could have been because they author had not updated them,  but I thought you were supposed to check for that when a version number was specified. Trying by using Chrome to go direct to the site and not using the Add-on manager produce extensions which add-on manager refused to add because they were not suitable for my version.  </p><p>When I tried the URLs you gave above tonight, they took me to a page which said they were all for my current version, 102.11.0. It did NOT do that the last time I tried. I got different pages when I specified en-uk to when I specified en-gb. As I said in my first letter, this seemed wrong to me - thank you for answering my first query and confirming that they were only language oriented differences.  My queries on Usenet gave me several URLs which I did not follow up as I thought at the time I had solved the problem. The first of these relates to Thunderbird, the others were Firefox oriented, but as it would appear it is the same server involved it would seem I am not the only one reporting bugs.  </p><p><a href=""https://github.com/thundernest/thunderbird-website/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/thundernest/thunderbird-website/issues</a> <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/addons-server/issues/4599"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/addons-server/issues/4599</a> <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/addons-server/issues/7535"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/addons-server/issues/7535</a> </p><p>As another example (there were several) I also enquired as to an old  extension called Compact Headers.  It did NOT show up when I searched for it from within the Add-on Manager. It did when I went first to the page with Chrome and used the drop down to search for v.102 extensions of that name - and it worked.  </p><p>I am aware of what Bugzilla is. I used Thunderbird from the days when it was, from memory,  Phoenix (?) and have posted on Bugzilla in the past. None of my bugs were dealt with despite being confirmed (one sat there for several years) hence my not bothering to go there yet. I was NOT thinking of going there for customer support but to look for similar bugs to mine being reported.  </p><p>This leaves me no better off than before except to know that tonight it worked when previously it was chaos. As I said, I have been using and installing extensions from day one of Thunderbird (possibly from before you joined the company? ) and am well aware of the extensions site's workings and how to use it. It was complete chaos when I tried before. Now, either it has been fixed very recently, or you have major but intermittent problems with the site, or my installation of Thunderbird is faulty in some way. </p>",robert.h.henson,false,0,0

Try them?  Do you see different results? </p><p>Just an FYI,  the entire Mozilla ecosystem of web sites are localized and the locale variable from the application accessing the web site is used to determine the language version that is picked up.  If the appropriate pages have not been localized (quite common for some languages) then the en_US text is used, but the URL does not change. </p> <blockquote>  I haven't been to Bugzilla yet - past experience dictates that it takes forever to get answers there  </blockquote> <p>That is because Bugzilla is a bug reporting and action site,  not a user support site.  These days they are just as likely to note the bug report is a support issue and simply close it as an invalid bug. Especially if the person doing triage can not reproduce the described behaviour with the information proffered.  Sometimes that might be me. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I have all inboxes sorted with the latest email at the top, then going down in time. If I open any account with, say, 7 new messages, it displays the 2 OLDEST of the unreads on the right side, with the 5 later ones hidden above. I have to scroll to the top to see them. I just want the thing to ALWAYS show the entire contents of the inbox in the right hand panel from the top/latest message down; new, old, read, unread, just display them from the top down. Again, I've been using TBird since it first came out many years ago; this only started a few updates back. I have 15 email accounts I monitor in TBird, and it's a fiddly PITA to have to do this constantly. I just want it to always show the inbox from the top message down, as it did previously. </p><p>Thanks again </p>",astral499,false,0,0
