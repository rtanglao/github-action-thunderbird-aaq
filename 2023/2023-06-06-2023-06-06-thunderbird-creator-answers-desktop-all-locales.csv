It just shows a blank screen and the message stays highlighted as not read.  Double clicking will open the message in a new window and when closing the message is flagged as read. Once I double click on a message, ""N"" will not open next message so I have to open and close each and every message. Worked yesterday but today's update did this. (All my setting are still the same) How can I migrate back to the previous version without loosing all my accounts, settings and etc... </p><p>This is messing up my business communication!
