This evening, instead of opening Thunderbird and downloading the messages immediately, I wen to my provider's webmail first. It showed an Inbox of 45 messages with 2.69 MB and a spam folder of 65 messages at 1 MB. I then opened Thunderbird and let it download the messages from the server. When I went back to webmail and refreshed the page it showed the Inbox was 0. So it appears that Thunderbird is downloading messages from the server Inbox and deleting them. So that's not the issue in this case. I think the issue is with the spam email folder. I noticed in recent times that I was getting fewer spam messages with the rest of the Inbox but thought they were just being deleted. I think the company had gotten more aggressive about putting spam in a folder in Webmail that I couldn't see on Thunderbird and things were not getting deleted. The company has a link to a spam filter section and I found that an ""auto-delete"" spam function was disabled. I had enabled it to delete spam with some arbitrary score they provided but it had turned back to disabled. So I think Thunderbird is OK and my provider has a crude spam function that you have to log into webmail every day to review. I appreciate your suggestions that led me to discover this. </p><p>Best Regards, </p><p>Howard </p>",hpatterson6,false,0,0

Did the emails get deleted specifically from the 'Inbox'? If deleted from 'Inbox', did they get moved to/appear in the 'Trash' folder or maybe the 'Archives' folder&nbsp;? </p><p>I'm wondering if the server is using a gmail style of storing emails. <strong>Q:</strong> In webmail account - do you have a folder that contains all the emails - maybe it's called 'All Mail' or something similar. </p><p>Does the server have a poicy to auto empty  Spam and Trash eg: after x days&nbsp;? </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I was reluctant to go that route because I was afraid it would delete messages from the server in one day whether I downloaded them or not.
