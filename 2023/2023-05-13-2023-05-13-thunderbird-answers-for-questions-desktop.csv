Is it possible that TB, not I, created GJunk? </blockquote> <p>No </p> <blockquote> 2. Regardless how it was created, will emails that I mark as Junk and ones that TB automatically classifies as Junk, be moved to GJunk? </blockquote> <p>There is a single junk folder for each account.  You could define that one as tyhe junk folder for the account.  But otherwise the answer is no. </p> <blockquote> 3. I think that there are some folders that TB creates automatically, right? Like Inbox, Trash, Sent.

It didn't get moved anywhere, it's still in Inbox. Later I sent another email to myself. It didn't get automatically marked as Junk. </blockquote> <p>Generally the failure to move mail to the junk folder falls into three categories. </p> <ol><li> The user has disabled the feature in account settings. re-enable it </li><li> The machine has a third party software that is locking the file when Thunderbird tries to update it. (File contention)  This is generally caused by antivirus product scanning.  The solution is exclude Thunderbird mail and IMAP mail folders from any scanning or otherwise identify the problematic third party software. </li><li> The folder is included as one of this that is backed to a cloud location or is stored on a local storage device like a NAS.

See <a href=""/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">Profiles - Where Thunderbird stores your messages and other user data</a> for a detailed explanation of what a profile is. I believe every Thunderbird user needs to know all they can about profiles. When you've finally understood what a profile is, head over to <a href=""/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-thunderbird-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">profile manager create and remove thunderbird profiles</a> and use the information there to create a new profile and launch it. The idea is to start with a fresh new profile and see if you can successfully setup your email account on that new profile using the password that has been confirmed to be working on webmail. A lot of times, issues users face with Thunderbird are a result of their profiles getting messed up or corrupted in some way, and starting afresh with a new profile is, in my opinion, the most effective approach in the long run, and also a good troubleshooting step to ascertain if the problem lies within a certain profile or elsewhere. </p>",stancestans,false,0,0
