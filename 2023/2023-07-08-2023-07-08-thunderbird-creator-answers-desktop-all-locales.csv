Essentially, clicking accept sent ""Accept"" using a ""not for work"" email account, instead of the work account that I received the invites in. </p><p>I think, it's using the first account. I' don't know how to test this. Is there a way to make the accept message use the account the invite was received in? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1589444;1589451;,cheyrn

I have created myself as the administrator user, and a second standard user on it. I haven't yet installed Thunderbird. Each of us has their own set of addins, but both include Cardbook and the Google Calendar Provider for syncing to our acconts, and with the intended standard user having an emoji add-on I don't use. </p><p>The aim is that when either of us log in, the Thunderbird app and our mails/calendars/address books are there, syncing as expected, with the data in the right places for a two-user computer. </p><p>I'd be grateful if someone could let me know the right sequence of steps to make that happen. Maybe not full detail for each step, but listing every install step in the right order so I don't louse it up. </p><p>I do think it's odd that it's easy to find stuff about two people having to share a Windows sign-in and switch Thunderbird profiles, or one person having a profile on multiple computers, but not what I'm doing, which is surely the right way for two people to share a PC! </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1589400;1589405;1589435;,carlwark

Funziona bene, ma, da quando l'ho installato, ogni giorno, quando faccio il backup del computer con CCC o Time Machine, vengono copiati nell'HD esterno TUTTI i messaggi email esistenti sul computer, oltre 50 GB di messaggi dal 2015 a oggi. Invece quando usavo Mail il backup, ovviamente, copiava soltanto i messaggi di posta nuovi, aggiungendoli a quelli già presenti nel backup precedente. Così Thunderbird mi sbrana l'HD esterno in pochi giorni. Come mai succede ciò soltanto con Thunderbird? Devo impostare qualcosa per rendere anche il suo backup incrementale? Vi ringrazio tanto e attendo un vostro gentile aiuto Luigi Pinna Sassari </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,it,1589407;1589428;,lpinna6
