I am unable to find a way to set the Thunderbird to autoformat URL as hyperlink, for instance, </p><p><a href=""https://nameofdomain.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nameofdomain.com</a>  I have to go to  Insert&gt; Link    to make the email appear as hyperlink a la word autoformat. </p><p>I just discovered that when I do type a URL and once sent the link is formatted to the sendee.  This is very minor thing but is there a way to see the URL autoformatted live as typed in the ""Write:""/compose window of Thunderbird? </p><p>Thanks for any comment </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",michaeljmann2000
