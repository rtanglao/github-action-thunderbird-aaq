The only problem was, they didn't bother letting me know. And I had no way of knowing because my email client, Thunderbird, was working perfectly. So, live and learn. The nice thing was, I was told that the waiting time would be over two hours because of an overload of calls, but the call was picked up almost immediately. LOL I take what I can get.
