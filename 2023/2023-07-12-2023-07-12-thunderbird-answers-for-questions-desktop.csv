I suppose many older extensions won't directly get updated, so it would be vital for me to test the installation. If my mails don't work, I can't work and I can't earn money&nbsp;:-D </p><p>If I cannot run them in parallel, I guess I should be able to create a second useraccount on my macos (I don't have a second computer) and install the new version just there, and choose a custom new profile (like I would for a parallel v115 install) </p>",supergarv,false,0,0

But that may not work for you as the beta is now beyond 115. My suggestion is to click to website of each addon to see if they show support for 115. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The only problem was, they didn't bother letting me know. And I had no way of knowing because my email client, Thunderbird, was working perfectly. So, live and learn. The nice thing was, I was told that the waiting time would be over two hours because of an overload of calls, but the call was picked up almost immediately. LOL I take what I can get. So, let this be a lesson, right? </p>",Cris47,false,0,0
