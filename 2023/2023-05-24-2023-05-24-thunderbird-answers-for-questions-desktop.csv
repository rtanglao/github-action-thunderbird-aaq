For example, if you have three POP accounts and you want them to be IMAP, then you can create three  new IMAP accounts with the same email addresses as the POP accounts, leaving you with six accounts. Once you are comfortable with the IMAP accounts, you can delete the POP accounts. HOWEVER, before deleting the POP accounts, I encourage you to MOVE any messages to be saved to local folders. You can do this by highlighting Local Folders, right-click and select 'new folder'. Assign a name and you can then move messages to be saved.

When I click on a message in the Message List, it is displayed in the Message Pane. It's status in the Message List should immediately change from Unread to Read. Much of the time it does this. But there are times when it takes 10 seconds or more to change from Unread to Read. I go through the list of new emails quickly, so I want the status to change immediately. I don't want to have to wait for 10 seconds or more for TB to change the status. I am using the ""Automatically mark messages as read Immediately on Display"" setting, so the message should go from Unread to Read immediately, but it often does not occur immediately. I can click on the ""Read Status"" dot to change the status, but I should not have to. Thank you. </p>",JWHardy,false,0,0

If you single-click it, it get's selected, but it remains unread because simply selecting a message does not count as opening that message. If you wish to mark a message as unread, you can do so by pressing the M key on your keyboard, or you can use the right-click menu.
