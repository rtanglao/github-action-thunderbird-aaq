(My autosave is set at every 5 minutes, in the Settings &gt; Composition).  I am hoping to recover a draft that I know was auto-saving, but in some apparently only in a temporary way that doesn't fully post to the Drafts folder.  </p><p>I had 4-5 email windows open in TBird, under composition.  They lingered as draft emails for several days, as I worked through a bookkeeping job and compiled lists of questions to email out.  In particular, one ""Draft"" is actually a long to-do file of notes, which I continuously update.  I regret not closing it more frequently in order to Save its latest version to the Drafts folder.  Instead, I got behind in my work and just left that ""write window"" open for weeks.  TBird abruptly closed/crashed last night, and those draft-emails I had open are gone, and not in the Drafts folder.  They are not Sent of Deleted/Trash either.  So its like they never existed since I didn't specifically say ""Save a Draft,"" but I believe they still auto-saved.   </p><p>Only my to-do list with is a longstanding ""Draft email""  is still existing, but it's the version from a couple weeks ago, which I guess is the last time I actually closed its ""write"" window!  (yes, I probably should restart TBird and my laptop more often).  I would like to recover the latest version of that draft, and ideally the handful of other emails I had open. </p><p>So would those auto-saved drafts exist in some mozilla hidden-folders or something??  It seems to me that the auto-saved drafts interact with the email server (1and1, via IMAP) somehow, because if my internet is out, any draft-email that I have sitting open keeps bugging me that it can't auto-save.  So it must autosave on a server, not just locally in a TBird file, right?   </p><p>I contacted 1and1 and they restored things deleted over the last few days, but that didn't help at all, probably because I hadn't actually deleted the drafts.  It's like they didn't get formally deleted because they were never formally saved as drafts, yet they existed &nbsp;:) </p><p>So where to look?   Thank you all!! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",heymali

I did a routine Thunderbird update on my Win 10 laptop, after which two Office 365 email addresses stopped 'authenticating' when I checked emails. </p><p>I checked Tools Passwords and saw that my passwords were replaced with 1125 characters of junk.

When I put a check in the box of a few messages and then click ""Delete,"" the system marks the topmost message that I had not selected with a checkmark after the selected e-mails delete.  If I don't notice it, I could start selecting messages to delete again and accidentally delete something I want to keep.  I have to remember to always uncheck the box.  This happens on my desktop; I don't think it happens on mobile, but I cannot remember for sure and have nothing to delete right now to test it.  Is there a way to make it not put a check box in the Select Messages box of the uppermost e-mail after deleting a number of messages?  I feel this is a bug that needs to be fixed.
