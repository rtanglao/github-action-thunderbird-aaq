I have tried everything suggested on this site but to no avail. I have asked te question on here as well. It's a great shame, having used Thunderbird for a long time. I need an email client. Are there any others I can use? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",robp100

When I put a check in the box of a few messages and then click ""Delete,"" the system marks the topmost message that I had not selected with a checkmark after the selected e-mails delete.  If I don't notice it, I could start selecting messages to delete again and accidentally delete something I want to keep.  I have to remember to always uncheck the box.  This happens on my desktop; I don't think it happens on mobile, but I cannot remember for sure and have nothing to delete right now to test it.  Is there a way to make it not put a check box in the Select Messages box of the uppermost e-mail after deleting a number of messages?  I feel this is a bug that needs to be fixed.  Please help if there is something I can toggle on my end.  Thanks. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",cookiemonster217

Periodically, I find that the ""Sort by"" setting has been forgotten, and I have to go back and return it to ""Order Received"". Is this a known issue? I haven't found any correlation between the incidence of this behavior and any actions I have taken -- except that when it does happen, I discover it upon changing accounts or upon opening Thunderbird. It doesn't seem to occur while I'm reading email within an account. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1586962;,firefox2357
