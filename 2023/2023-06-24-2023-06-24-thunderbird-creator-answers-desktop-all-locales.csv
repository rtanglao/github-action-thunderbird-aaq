Periodically, I find that the ""Sort by"" setting has been forgotten, and I have to go back and return it to ""Order Received"". Is this a known issue? I haven't found any correlation between the incidence of this behavior and any actions I have taken -- except that when it does happen, I discover it upon changing accounts or upon opening Thunderbird. It doesn't seem to occur while I'm reading email within an account. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1586962;,firefox2357
