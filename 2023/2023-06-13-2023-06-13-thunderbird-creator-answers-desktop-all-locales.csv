I've tried reinstalling, rebooting, manual config, and deleting the profile in %appdata%.  Manual config gives me an error saying the ""Incoming server already exists"". </p><p>Any ideas on what else to try? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",orders40

Also, if the email copy is clicked a couple of times the whole message is wiped away and can only be restored by hovering over the Thunderbird icon on the bottom bar. It then reappears as the normal ""write"" page. </p><p>A concurrent problem, not sure they are related, is Thunderbird dropping the connection to the server. This happens only in T.B.   To fix this I get the modem info on the screen (which always shows ""connected"") and click ""disconnect"". After 10 seconds or so, go there again and click ""connect"". Everything comes back to normal operation, for awhile. This happened 7 or 8 times today. Comcast techs were not able to solve this through at least 5 different levels of help, so maybe you can.  Using a new Motorola modem/router model MOTO41A4  with WiFi connection to the computer. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",60142118

I renamed a folder using the webmail portal for my email provider and it looks fine on the webmail interface. But now the folder is not shown in Thunderbird. During troubleshooting I relocated the folder to a subfolder and its still not shown. I have restarted Thunderbird, did a minor upgrade from 102.2.0, relocated the folder using webmail again, but its still not shown. Does anyone know the solution to make the folder display again? Thanks </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",mcfbiz
