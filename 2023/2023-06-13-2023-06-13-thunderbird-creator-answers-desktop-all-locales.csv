Now this account won't link to server, can't dlete or reinstal.just locked in a loop.","<p><strong>bold text</strong>Late Thursday, 06/08/2023, or early Friday, my e-mail on Thunderbird went down. I saw a News notice about a large Internet e-mail outage in the US. I then tried to use MS Outlook on my WINDOWS 7 PC, it was also not responding, then Webmail and found it nonresponsive, and last Mail on Windows 10 was down. I concluded that it must be an Internet problem, so I waited. Later I found Mail on Windows 10 and Webmail in my browser both working.  On my Windows 10 Thunderbird and MS Outlook on my Windows 7, remained nonresponsive. I installed Thunderbird on my Windows 7, as I wasn’t using the Outlook program. Thunderbird remained nonresponsive all weekend and was still down today, (Monday 6/12/23). It gives me a pop-up window [Login to account""daveandleslie@nebnet.net"" failed], and 3 options, “Retry”, “Enter New Password “, and “Cancel”. Retry, entering the password and even cancel just causes a delay, then the window pops back up. I tried to uninstall and reinstall Thunderbird, and it installs with my e-mail already set up as it was before I uninstalled Thunderbird. I am back to exactly where IK started this morning. I looked for a way to delete the account, couldn’t find a way to do that. I tried to add it as  a new e-mail account, that tells it already exists. So how do I fix this? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",DWC4656
