Since you prefer to just restore accounts, then I suggest you locate all the folders and, with Thunderbird not running, copy them into the Mail\Local Folders folder of the current profile.

I do not understand why you just want one account. However, if you already have thunderbird working with an addressbook and some accounts and want to restore one more, then, assuming the account is POP, you could  - add the account, but omit retrieving any messages.  - exit thunderbird and copy the folders in your screenshot to overwrite the folders created when you recreated the account  - restart thunderbird  </p><p>But that's dicey.

Notice the drop-down menu at top. It probably says 'latin' or 'other writing systems' - this is IMPORTANT:  - select 'latin from that menu, set your desired font and font size settings, click OK,  - select 'otherwritingsystems' from the drop-down menu and set the IDENTICAL settings to what you did for Latin, and then click OK. In attached screenshots you will see my latin and otherwritingsystem match.  Notice I also set monospace font. - and, if you have account set to compose HTML, then set that in tools&gt;settings&gt;composition to variable-width and medium font. (You would only change the HTML font setting if your intent is for recipient to receive your preferred font - not my personal recommendation.) - Set Sending Format to 'automatic'  </pre> <p>With these settings, your compose window and your sent folders will match. And if you don't write HTML (e.g., bold, italic, color), none will be sent . If you do these settings once, your font will always be consistent.
