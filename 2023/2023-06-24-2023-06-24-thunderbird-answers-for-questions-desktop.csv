Too much assumption on my part. 123.reg in their own words. 123 Reg: Domains, websites, email and web hosting services. I have an email address hosted by them. When I received my PC back with its new hard drive, the repair company couldn't get me logged to 123-reg with the provided password. I have since changed the password, hoping to get in, but with no joy. I just get a message saying that my password is not recognised. However, I can get into their webmail and see my emails. The support think there is some issue between Thunderbird and their site. I've checked firewalls and Windows security settings </p>",robp100,false,0,0
