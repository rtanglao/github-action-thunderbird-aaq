Puzzling. You might try deleting the password to see if you are then prompted for a password. You can do that at settings&gt;privacy&amp;security. click 'saved passwords' and then 'show passwords' and then highlight the two rows for your account and delete them. That retains the account but with no passwords. That should prompt for a password. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Too much assumption on my part. 123.reg in their own words. 123 Reg: Domains, websites, email and web hosting services. I have an email address hosted by them.

I have since changed the password, hoping to get in, but with no joy. I just get a message saying that my password is not recognised. However, I can get into their webmail and see my emails.
