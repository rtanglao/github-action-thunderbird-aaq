Too much assumption on my part. 123.reg in their own words. 123 Reg: Domains, websites, email and web hosting services. I have an email address hosted by them. When I received my PC back with its new hard drive, the repair company couldn't get me logged to 123-reg with the provided password. I have since changed the password, hoping to get in, but with no joy. I just get a message saying that my password is not recognised. However, I can get into their webmail and see my emails. The support think there is some issue between Thunderbird and their site. I've checked firewalls and Windows security settings </p>",robp100,false,0,0

Thunderbird is there twice because it's installed on my desktop and laptop, as mentioned above. </p><p>I removed my Office 365 account from my laptop's Thunderbird, then re-added it. Still no luck â€“ but I did lose all emails I had received until last night, although I specifically chose not to delete them when removing the account. </p><p>It looks like my Thunderbird updated to 102.12.0 a while ago, so the problem should not be connected to an app update. I don't think the admin at my university would perform a server update Friday evening, so it's little likely that this could be the root of the problem. </p>",cheeseus,true,0,0
