I have a new install of Thunderbird 102.12 (running on Windows 10).  I have installed the OWL add-on, so the email accounts are now using ""OWL-EWS"" server protocol. Everything works fine, as far as my different email accounts sending and receiving new emails. </p><p>My problem is trying to import my old 20+ years of emails and the whole folder heirarchy from all my past clients and business dealings into the new install of Thunderbird. I have tried using the import method with various file types, I have tried just copying the folders in manually.  Nothing seems to work, I either get errors or Thunderbird just doesn't recognize the old folders. </p><p>FYI - I also have bought the full paid version of the Thunderbird Migration Wizard software from <a href=""http://recoverytools.com"" rel=""nofollow"">recoverytools.com</a>.  With this, I can change my old emails folders/files into practically any format. </p><p>What is the proper way to import my old stuff??? This is driving me crazy and really killing my business productivity. </p><p>I would appreciate any pointers, I can't be the only one having issues with this.... thanks! </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1586846;,chris554
