It is indeed a Titanic struggle! I have tried to avoid ms Outlook because I can not remember the account password and can't seem to find a way to retrieve it or change it over to a new one. This is stopping me from setting up a new version of Thunderbird (my preferred e-mail) as I find the ""outlook"" to be a total pain in the arse. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",RussTBear

Everytime I try to send a message the window greys out and when I try to close it tells me ""saving to drafts"" Then when I go into drafts it won't send. Have attached a screenshot but not sure you will be able to pick out that it has greyed out. All other functions seem to work OK including calender and address book. Incoming mail is received OK too. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated. Should I uninstall and re-install or is there a simpler fix anyone. </p><p>nfhounsome@gmail.com </p><p>Many thanks </p><p>Nigel </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1586845;,nfhounsome

I have a new install of Thunderbird 102.12 (running on Windows 10).  I have installed the OWL add-on, so the email accounts are now using ""OWL-EWS"" server protocol. Everything works fine, as far as my different email accounts sending and receiving new emails. </p><p>My problem is trying to import my old 20+ years of emails and the whole folder heirarchy from all my past clients and business dealings into the new install of Thunderbird. I have tried using the import method with various file types, I have tried just copying the folders in manually.  Nothing seems to work, I either get errors or Thunderbird just doesn't recognize the old folders. </p><p>FYI - I also have bought the full paid version of the Thunderbird Migration Wizard software from <a href=""http://recoverytools.com"" rel=""nofollow"">recoverytools.com</a>.  With this, I can change my old emails folders/files into practically any format. </p><p>What is the proper way to import my old stuff??? This is driving me crazy and really killing my business productivity. </p><p>I would appreciate any pointers, I can't be the only one having issues with this.... thanks! </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1586846;,chris554
