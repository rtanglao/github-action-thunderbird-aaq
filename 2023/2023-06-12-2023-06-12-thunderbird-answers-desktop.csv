Based on your suggestion and my findings, I went back into Outlook, grabbed one of the 111 problem files, and looked at the source: Even though the Subject and date stamp are shown correctly, the source is WRONG!!!! The source has the same errant Subject and date stamp as was imported! I checked a couple more and found the same. </p><p>Okay, so re-importing is out. But stepping away from what I can do for a minute to what happened. I think I know: Since I've been sending this series to the same several people, I have created each new message by opening the previous message and selecting ""Resend"". I'm guessing that Outlook sees all the 111 messages as the same message repeated. (I've done this a few times with TB accounts also [Edit as New Message]; I'll have to look back at their source.) </p><p>Back to fixing: So okay, if I decide I can't live with 111 ""identical"" messages, is it possible to edit the underlying file? I make this to be: </p><pre>[Identity]\[profile]\Mail\Local Folders\Outlook.sbd\Sent Items </pre> <p>And more importantly, if I do edit here, is there any kind of character count or coding within the file that will cause me to trash the file if I change it? (I tried this once with Juno mail, about 20 years ago.) </p><p>I might have a few messages in other folders with this problem, but those will be only pairs or triplets, so no worries. </p><p>Meanwhile, I now know that the present FB import function works, at least mostly. </p><p>Thanks again! </p>",mdforme,false,0,0

I think I got Firefox from the Microsoft Store, but I can't be certain about it. </p><p>The button on the More Troubleshooting Information does not take you to the correct location. You get a Windows Explorer window with an error message stating that the location (directory/folder) can not be found. I think that I tried the profiles page as well, with the same result.  </p><p>I'm not a programmer, but it _may_ be that (some of) the directory data in this page is ""hard coded"" somehow, rather than using information from a configuration file. If so, changing this page to use information from a config file, and/or passing directory information from the installation process to a config file might be worthwhile in a future release.  </p><p>Would removing Firefox from my computer and then downloading it directly from Mozilla create profiles in the directory that shows on the Troubleshooting Information page when I re-install it? I'm a bit reluctant to go through setting up preferences/options all over again, but I'm willing to do so in order to keep things as ""unconfused"" as possible.  </p><p>Thanks again. </p>",Irgendjemand,false,0,0

This is also a leading cause of compact failures.   </p><p>The leading cause of these contention issues is the ubiquitous antivirus product that is scanning this huge file every time it changes.   They are inherently slow,  taking something like 10 minutes per gigabyte.  Lots of folk have an inbox that is more than a few Gigbytes in size and updated every 10 minutes or so.
