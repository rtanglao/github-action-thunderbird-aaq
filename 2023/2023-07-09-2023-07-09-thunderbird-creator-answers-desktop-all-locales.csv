My email server is an ISP's IMAP server [NOT a Google server:-]. On my Android phone I use the regular Google ""contacts"" program, which correctly synchronizes to <a href=""https://contacts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://contacts.google.com</a>. And I'm using the 64-bit version of TB 102.13.0.) </p><p>The vast majority of the recipes I can find do not work at all, probably either because they assume Gmail is somehow involved (it's NOT), or because <a href=""https://contacts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://contacts.google.com</a> does not offer the expected services (as Gmail does), or because they do their job once and quit, rather than keeping the two lists in sync in perpetuity.  </p><p>The recipe that seemed to do the best didn't involve either TB or Android at all, but rather involved going to Windows 10 Setup-&gt;Accounts-&gt;Email and Accounts-&gt;Add an account-&gt;Google.  Unfortunately every time I clicked on the big 'G', it would appear to be doing something for a while (10 seconds?), but then simply quit with no error message and no changes to the list of accounts (i.e. the desired new Google account was _not_ created.) </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",chuck68

Historically, I have had no problem pasting images I have copied into emails that I am composing.  Using a simple ctrl-V always worked fine for me.  For some reason, I can no longer do this. When I ctrl-V paste into the message body, nothing happens.  Similarl, if I Insert/Image and select a file, an outline box just displays with no image in it.   Through test emailing from another account, I have found that the only way I can send an image is to file attach it to the message I am composing.  The resulting email displays the image correctly in the body text area.   What is up with this?   I have tried reinstalling Thunderbird from the most current download from the Mozilla website - did not help at all. I have gone into my google account in a web browser and while composing an email message, ctrl-v inserts an image just fine.     What gives?   It seems like this may have been affected in the last update. My current version is 102.13.0 </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",rlgrafx
