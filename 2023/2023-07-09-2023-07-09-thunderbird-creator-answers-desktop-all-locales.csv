Historically, I have had no problem pasting images I have copied into emails that I am composing.  Using a simple ctrl-V always worked fine for me.  For some reason, I can no longer do this. When I ctrl-V paste into the message body, nothing happens.  Similarl, if I Insert/Image and select a file, an outline box just displays with no image in it.   Through test emailing from another account, I have found that the only way I can send an image is to file attach it to the message I am composing.  The resulting email displays the image correctly in the body text area.   What is up with this?   I have tried reinstalling Thunderbird from the most current download from the Mozilla website - did not help at all. I have gone into my google account in a web browser and while composing an email message, ctrl-v inserts an image just fine.     What gives?   It seems like this may have been affected in the last update. My current version is 102.13.0 </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",rlgrafx
