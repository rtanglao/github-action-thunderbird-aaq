The location shown is ""<a href=""http://mail.purplepapyrus.com:2080"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.purplepapyrus.com:2080</a>"" and cites an outdated certificate.   If you remove the port&nbsp;:2080 and request to get the certificate, it finds an up to date certification.   It will not add an exception either through this window, or via the certificate manager.   I have removed all CALDAV calendar and contacts from Thunderbird, removed the old certificate via the manager, and yet it comes back the next time I start Thunderbird.   I have completely removed Thunderbird on the one the computers and reinstalled.  Still happening.  Oh, I should point out I am still sending and receiving emails, just the calendar and contacts that are not syncing/working.  </p><p>Perplexed! </p><p>Pierre </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",pierre40

Uso calendari e rubrica, e non so se la lentezza dipendaanche da questo. Quando avvio Thunderbird, devo talvolta aspettare qualche minuto perché mi risponda ai comandi. Se invio un'email, fino a che non è finita tutta la fase di invio e copia locale, il programma non fa null'altro. Ho il sospetto che siano problemi di rete, come se alcune attività non fossero asincrone, ma occorra aspettare sempre la fine di ogni operazione prima di iniziarne un'altra. Però ricordo bene che, una volta, l'invio delle email era asincrono, non mi obbligava ad aspettare la fine delle operazioni. Cosa si può fare per tornare ad una velocità decente?
