If I close it, often it hangs with the little blue bar at the bottom indicating it is doing something.  I wait for a while, and if is still not working, I close it and any other programs and reboot the computer.  I read on your support site that it may be too much stuff in junk, so I deleted everything there.  I also said to delete junk when I signify junk.   </p><p>I get tons of junk mail and requests for money from organizations.  I have several email accounts and use the unified inbox.  I haven't found any other email programs that allow me to have personalities for my email accounts so really like Thunderbird. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",patnsandy

Her existing email account is with Thunderbird and we want to ensure that while she's taking every precaution to inform people that she will now only be using her new Gmail email address, if any emails do happen to trickle into the old Thunderbird account she doesn't miss them. </p><p>We've discussed setting up autoforwarding in Thunderbird so that everything flows to the new account seamlessly. </p><p>I'm not familiar with Thunderbird and she is not the most tech savvy person, and due to the confidential nature of her business I won't be able to help configure these setting for her. </p><p>I'd like to send her some detailed instructions so she can set it up on her own, does anyone have any instructions on how to do this? </p><p>Thank you so much, I really appreciate any insight! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1587228;,LMTD

I have tried all day and looked everywhere online for help. NOTHING WORKS. I have looked on GoDaddy and Microsoft and Thunderbird and done dozens of Google searches and nothing has worked. </p><p>I have email on Thunderbird with Office365. *It was working until Friday afternoon. Suddenly *ALL* of my email folder emptied. Nothing there. They are still my webmail (<a href=""http://godaddy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">godaddy.com</a>), but nothing in Thunderbird. I have the latest version. I deleted my existing account as loui@louitucker.com. I created a new one. Nothing changed. I CAN SEND, and a copy goes in my Sent folder in my local Thunderbird's loui@louitucker.com account. </p><p>When I SEND an email, it goes out - no problem there - and people are responding because I can read them on my phone or webmail. A copy of the message shows up in my Sent Folder. I have always sent a copy to myself at loui@louitucker.com but I never get that copy. My Inbox remains empty. The email comes to my phone, but not to my Thunderbird account. </p><p>I have looked everywhere and I tried every setting I can think of, but nothing changes. My incoming email will not download to Thunderbird. HELP HELP HELP. This driving my crazy. I depend on Thunderbird to organize and save old emails in local folders. I DO NOT WANT to rely on webmail. </p><p>Can you HELP ME PLEASE? Can anyone? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1587210;,loui1
