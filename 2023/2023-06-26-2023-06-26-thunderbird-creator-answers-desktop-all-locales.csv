I use Mozilla to view all my emails and have multiple folders with emails stored in them.  Do I need to copy over all the emails to my new gmail account or will they stay filed in Mozilla?

Uso calendari e rubrica, e non so se la lentezza dipendaanche da questo. Quando avvio Thunderbird, devo talvolta aspettare qualche minuto perché mi risponda ai comandi. Se invio un'email, fino a che non è finita tutta la fase di invio e copia locale, il programma non fa null'altro. Ho il sospetto che siano problemi di rete, come se alcune attività non fossero asincrone, ma occorra aspettare sempre la fine di ogni operazione prima di iniziarne un'altra. Però ricordo bene che, una volta, l'invio delle email era asincrono, non mi obbligava ad aspettare la fine delle operazioni. Cosa si può fare per tornare ad una velocità decente?

If I close it, often it hangs with the little blue bar at the bottom indicating it is doing something.  I wait for a while, and if is still not working, I close it and any other programs and reboot the computer.  I read on your support site that it may be too much stuff in junk, so I deleted everything there.  I also said to delete junk when I signify junk.   </p><p>I get tons of junk mail and requests for money from organizations.  I have several email accounts and use the unified inbox.  I haven't found any other email programs that allow me to have personalities for my email accounts so really like Thunderbird. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",patnsandy

I have looked on GoDaddy and Microsoft and Thunderbird and done dozens of Google searches and nothing has worked. </p><p>I have email on Thunderbird with Office365. *It was working until Friday afternoon. Suddenly *ALL* of my email folder emptied. Nothing there. They are still my webmail (<a href=""http://godaddy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">godaddy.com</a>), but nothing in Thunderbird. I have the latest version. I deleted my existing account as loui@louitucker.com. I created a new one. Nothing changed. I CAN SEND, and a copy goes in my Sent folder in my local Thunderbird's loui@louitucker.com account. </p><p>When I SEND an email, it goes out - no problem there - and people are responding because I can read them on my phone or webmail. A copy of the message shows up in my Sent Folder. I have always sent a copy to myself at loui@louitucker.com but I never get that copy. My Inbox remains empty. The email comes to my phone, but not to my Thunderbird account. </p><p>I have looked everywhere and I tried every setting I can think of, but nothing changes. My incoming email will not download to Thunderbird. HELP HELP HELP. This driving my crazy. I depend on Thunderbird to organize and save old emails in local folders. I DO NOT WANT to rely on webmail. </p><p>Can you HELP ME PLEASE? Can anyone? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1587210;1587239;1587240;,loui1
