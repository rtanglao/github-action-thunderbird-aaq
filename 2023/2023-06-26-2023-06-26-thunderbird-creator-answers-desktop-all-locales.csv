I left that position and someone else then occupied it. My access to that account was then removed by the sysadmin &amp; new loggin details given to the new occupant. I deleted all account/server settings, having transferred all previous in and out emails to a local folder, from my Thunderbird. At the user level at least, there is no visible sign of that account remaining.  However, I keep getting a pop-up that the server for that account requests me to provide authentication details for that deleted account. As far as I know the new occupant of the position is using that account without a problem. How can I stop getting that pop-up? It is very annoying, as it appears on top of whatever other program/window I ma using at the time. Any help?
