I followed the directions very specifically, but I never received the message at the end where I could choose to replace my current and data. I am not certain what is happening. I am inclined to delete the Thunderbird app because, I assume, that will also delete all of the data that I transferred to the new computer (old computer and email are still operational). Then I tried the import tool, but nothing happened. Any ideas as to what is going on? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",rhill304

I used to think there was something peculiar going on with either my wife's computer or her methods until it happened to me for the first time ever this morning. I used the same procedure as just described and the problem is fixed. However, now I'm wondering if this is an issue that could be addressed in a future Tbird update.
