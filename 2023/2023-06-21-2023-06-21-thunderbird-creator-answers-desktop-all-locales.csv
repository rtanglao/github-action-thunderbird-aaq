There are 162 nstmp files which account for 73GB of this and one INBOX file of 39GB. The INBOX I can believe as reasonable but I've formed the impression from reading other threads in the help pages that the nstmp files can be erased. Perhaps not the most recent? Is this the case? I have a total of three rocketmail (yahoo) email accounts. </p><p>Jim </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",jimcrawford.oxford

With the help and support of Tbird experts I was able to fix the issue by deleting the trash and trash.msf files in the [gmail].sbd folder and restarting Tbird. I used to think there was something peculiar going on with either my wife's computer or her methods until it happened to me for the first time ever this morning. I used the same procedure as just described and the problem is fixed. However, now I'm wondering if this is an issue that could be addressed in a future Tbird update.
