Looking at the Tbird certificate store the stored certificate is out of date, but the certificate on the domain and in the windows certificate store is current. I'm running Windows 10, 64 bit, version 22H2, Thunderbird 102.11.0(64Bit). IMAP server for domain <a href=""http://thebarretts.net.au"" rel=""nofollow"">thebarretts.net.au</a>. I have a couple of laptops plus a PC, all have the same issue, started on 9thMay, when the certificate expired. The attached screen shots show the error, the Windows certificate store, the certificate in Tbird and the certificate information stored in the domain. The email still works provide I cancel the add exception window, my calendar and contacts also fail. I have tried a number of tests such as restart in safe mode with networking to see if anything else could be affecting this, also added and exception in Tbird but this doesn't make any difference, checked that my AV (Kaspersky Premium) has an exception for the domain, turned off Kaspersky but same issue when Tbird starts, turned off Tbird addons but still fails. Tried to import a replacement certificate but Tbird tells me the certificate exist so will not import. Can anyone help me resolve this issue? If you need more info, screen shots or other data please let me know. Cheers Rob </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1581198;1581222;,rob216

I recently installed an old saved version 59.x.x [Correction, was Ver 52.8.0] of Thunderbird on new Laptop and started Thunderbird, choosing to later create Email account data. Stayed in long enough to set few things including Auto Update to OFF and then exited (didn't want any surprises right now).  I then (in file manager) copied the all the contents of my Postbox 3.x Profile (the root folder files and Mail Folder, did not include minidumps) to the new created Thunderbird Profile (overwriting everything with same name). Then restarted Thunderbird and Popup came up saying migration updating or something like that, but it came up with all my old Postbox email folders and email and all my account settings. My old Postbox profile had the [ ] Check for new messages at startup UNCHECKED, which that all came up in Thunderbird just fine. Because I wanted to check Thunderbird out a bit before I started taking stuff off the server with it.  I then checked the TB version and it was then 60.9.1 (32bit).  So it did update which was surprising since I had updates set to OFF both in Thunderbird and the old Postbox Profile accounts. Ok so whatever with that, the thing I wish I could change now is there any way to hide the Subject Column in the Message list. I only need Correspondents and Date,  the Subject is in the message at left anyhow. But for some reason Subject is not listed in the column selection drop down. Also all the messages in the inbox that I replied to have arrows pointing Left and cannot seem to make them go away. Just wondering what's all that about.

Sometimes I might not realize it until much, much later, and by then I've missed dozens upon dozens of email messages. </p><p>At first this happened when I was still using POP on a gmail inbox.  The only way I could trigger Thunderbird to start re-syncing again was to completely shut down Thunderbird and reopen it.  It gets really annoying having to do this so frequently. </p><p>At some point, I decided to convert to IMAP.  This works only marginally better.  Thunderbird still occasionally stops syncing, but usually I just have to navigate to a different folder and then back to Inbox, to get it to start again.  But it may take several minutes before the messages start flowing in. </p><p>I can't see that there are any errors happening, but maybe I don't know where to look.  I'm perfectly happy to look for error logs or whatever to help troubleshoot the issue. </p><p>I really don't like the gmail interface on Chrome, and the phone app is even worse, and would hate to have to stop using Thunderbird.
