It's a free account and, as I understand, is now called web-based Outlook or <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>.  This is different from the paid desktop version of Outlook.  I understand my version of Outlook stores emails in the cloud, not on my local PC.   </p><p>I've been notified that cloud-based storage for my emails is nearing maximum capacity.  One option is to pay for more storage but I'm reluctant to do that.  Further, I would like to create copies of my emails, store them on my local PC, and then delete the oldest from Outlook.  That frees up cloud-based storage AND lets me preserve the emails on my own hardware.  After MANY chats with forum volunteers knowledgeable about Outlook, I've learned that only the desktop version of Outlook has the ability to export folders of emails to my local PC for archiving.  Also, those emails would only be viewable using desktop Outlook.  In all cases, the volunteers also suggested Thunderbird as a method for archiving my emails.  That's why I'm here. </p><p>I've checked through as many old posts as possible but would still like a bit of encouragement before downloading and using Thunderbird.  Here are my very basic questions: </p><p>1.  Will Thunderbird allow me to access and download email folders from my web-based Outlook program? 2.  Once the emails are safely on my local PC, what software will I need to open and read the messages?  My current mail program (Outlook)?  Thunderbird?  Something else? 3.  As I understand it, my version of Outlook stores messages in Folders, as opposed to Gmail which uses labels.  Will I be able to preserve my Folders in the archiving process or do all archived emails go into one large folder?  By the way, I'm not looking for automatic archiving; I'd be happy to archive manually once per year. </p><p>Many thanks in advance.  I look forward to giving Thunderbird a try. </p><p>Dick </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1585660;1585680;1585686;1585696;,rjfelts
