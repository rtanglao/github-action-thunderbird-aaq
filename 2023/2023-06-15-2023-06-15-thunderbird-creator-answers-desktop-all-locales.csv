When I restarted my computer, all of the ""sent"" emails had vanished from all three email addresses I have in Thunderbird. There are multiple versions in the profile folder, named with the email address, and -1 and -2 versions. Large ""sent"" files/folders are there in one of the duplicates, but obviously not being accessed. Inboxes seem to be ok. How do I safely clean up this mess?

Habitualmente voy eliminando en el servidor, a través del Webmail, todos aquellos correos que no me importan. Estos correos van a la papelera y también la vacío. Hasta ahí todo bien porque al sincronizar también se eliminan en local. El problema surge cuando, para ganar espacio, tengo que eliminar en el servidor correos que no quiero perder, porque también se pierden en local y esto es lo que quiero evitar. Lo he intentado pero no veo como hacer la copia de seguridad, ni donde se guardaría. Las respuestas que he encontrado hasta ahora de otras consultas, no he podido o sabido aplicarlas. Manualmente no veo como hacerlo, a no ser correo a correo, lo que es muy poco práctico. Además necesito en un primer paso archivar una gran cantidad de correos antiguos que están en las carpetas anuales de la carpeta Archivos. </p><p>Gracias por vuestra ayuda </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,es,"",markko003

When I delete a message from my inbox or even any of my local folders, the deleted message does not move to my Trash folder.  Basically, the email is gone.  I looked through all the various TB settings and cannot find any that would cause this action.  I really want the deleted emails to go into the Trash folder in case I make an error deleting the wrong email one day.

But now it won't download my mail, and I can't find any way to try entering the password again.  (My password is not saved.)  When I click ""Get messages"" the blue progress bar flickers at the bottom of the screen briefly but the Activity Manager remains blank.  No mail is downloaded and there are no progress messages.  There is also a small ""null"" note at bottom left, not sure whether that's related. </p><p>I have tried restarting Thunderbird several times, and restarting my computer entirely.  No difference.  I went into Settings / Privacy and Security and confirmed that there is no password saved.  None of the settings have been changed.  But I'm not getting an error message when I try to download mail, it's not doing anything at all (aside from the brief flicker of the progress bar). </p><p>I tried sending a test message and got the error ""Sending of the message failed.

The server may be unavailable or is refusing SMTP connections. Please verify that your Outgoing server (SMTP) settings are correct and try again.""  But none of my settings have changed.  I can access my mail via web server so there isn't a problem with the ISP.  But answering mail that way is really clumsy and time-consuming.  I need my Thunderbird! </p><p>I am using Thunderbird 102.12.0 with Windows 10 Pro.  I have been a happy Thunderbird user for many years (since 2015 I think) and have never encountered this problem before.  I really hope you can tell me how to solve it, I am aware of several time-sensitive messages in my mailbox and I can't download anything.

I've used Thunderbird for years and had to create a new version of my IMAP account using EXCHANGE. I did that. I know it was successful because the EXCHANGE account showed up in Thunderbird and I then spent days transferring emails from the old IMAP account personal email folders into duplicate folders in the new EXCHANGE account.   </p><p>Then today I closed my browser. When I re-opened Thunderbird, the new EXCHANGE account was absent. Since I can't use the old IMAP account any more, I tried again to create an EXCHANGE account. When I tried to do that, I got a message that ""the server already exists"" (see image below) and I am unable to complete the task. </p><p>So the previously created EXCHANGE account has disappeared, with all my emails in it, I can't create a new one, and the IMAP no longer works (and won't accept my password to send or receive). I feel completely stuck and I've lost several years of emails. </p><p>The fact that the message said that the server already exists makes me think and hope that my EXCHANGE account still exists somewhere. Can you help me find it? Many thanks in advance.  Steve </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",steve.ross.karuna
