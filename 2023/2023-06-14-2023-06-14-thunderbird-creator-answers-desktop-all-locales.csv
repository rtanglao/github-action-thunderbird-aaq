In version 114.x during the creation of a new Calendar, FB asked that type of calendar, I selected  Network Calendar, then it asked to select between iCal and CalDav.  Now in 115 it DOES not ask if I want to create an iCal or CalDav.  This causes a failure to create an iCal Calendar based on the shared link, it says the credentials are not correct. But iCal is not supposed to ask for credentials Is there another way to specify that I want to create a iCal calendar? </p>",calendar;tbbetasn;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,"",titustucan

I had about 6 email addresses in there already with thousands of emails. I'm guessing maybe the profile file or mail files got corrupted with the power outage. What is the best way forward?
