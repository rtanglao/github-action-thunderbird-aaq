Problem is, each email gets LONGER and LONGER because both me and the recipient have replied with quotes.  I have tried a couple different add ons and even thunderbird conversations but they all did the same thing.  Thunderbird conversations add on actually collapses quotes but had some weird feature where it would print out an email twice and I couldn't figure out why, so It had to go. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",gsrgtrdg4565653

In version 114.x during the creation of a new Calendar, FB asked that type of calendar, I selected  Network Calendar, then it asked to select between iCal and CalDav.  Now in 115 it DOES not ask if I want to create an iCal or CalDav.  This causes a failure to create an iCal Calendar based on the shared link, it says the credentials are not correct. But iCal is not supposed to ask for credentials Is there another way to specify that I want to create a iCal calendar? </p>",calendar;tbbetasn;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1585402;,titustucan
