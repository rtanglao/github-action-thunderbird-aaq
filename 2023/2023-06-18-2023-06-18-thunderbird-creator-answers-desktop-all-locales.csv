Using an office computer requires those contacts to be accurate on both systems and updated in the back ground.  Use of Google to do this is out of the question due to the lack of Groups or it's called Label. An organizational field like Doctors or Customer service.  I notice some these fields on my phone contact are nonexistent on Thunderbird contacts.  Why?  I thought it was converted to VCard format with contains many more fields. Editing a Contact only shows a minimal number of fields compared to VCard. CardDAV just looks confusing and I can't tell what is what, and causes duplicates. So why is there no merge without duplicates if the same Name field is already on file.  I've tried to use tools like BirdieSync, but it just duplicates every dam contact causing a mess.  This is really a problem because computers are here to make life better not add more work. So, before I get rid of TB just what is down the road for this problem?  My phone Contact software should have a APP that connects to my PC and copies new contacts or updates contacts to the Thunderbird contacts and visa versa. If they are both using VCard what's the problem? PC to Phone and phone to PC, without Google or Microsoft data theft of my contacts. Any Ideas? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",bmazak

The difference between 102.10.0 versus 102.10.04 is negligible. even the current 102.10.0 versus 102.12.0 is not worth the bother.
