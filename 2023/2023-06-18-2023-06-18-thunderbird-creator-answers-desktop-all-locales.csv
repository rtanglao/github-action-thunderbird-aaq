I have a company Gmail account (myname@companyname.com), with a delegated account (info@companyname.com), for which I don't have the password, as I can only acces it from the Gmail web site. How can I configure Thunderbird (version 102) to access the delegated account? I have tried several tutorials, but none worked. I can access my personal account perfectly, but can't access the shared one. Is there any updated step-by-step to configure this? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1586158;,rasteserdi

I didn't see instructions for that specific scenario.  If there are instructions, please point me to them and I apologize for missing them. </li></ol> <ol><li>2)  When WLM messages are 'exported', does the exportation result in the messages being deleted from WLM file location?  That is, does exporting mean that a COPY of the messages are exported and the original messages are left in place? </li></ol> <ol><li>3)  I have my WLM messages in many folders and subfolders.  Can the folders and subfolders be transferred to Thunderbird on a second computer in one step WHILE PRESERVING AND AUTOMATICALLY RECREATING IN THUNDERBIRD THE EXACT SAME FOLDER/SUBFOLDER LAYOUT AS EXISTS IN WLM WITH THE SAME FOLDER/SUBFOLDER NAMES AND CONTENT? </li></ol> <p>I'm not overly technical, so I appreciate replies in simple terms.   </p><p>Thanks in advance for the help. </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1586145;1586152;1586153;1586155;1586157;,cvancant

Using an office computer requires those contacts to be accurate on both systems and updated in the back ground.  Use of Google to do this is out of the question due to the lack of Groups or it's called Label. An organizational field like Doctors or Customer service.  I notice some these fields on my phone contact are nonexistent on Thunderbird contacts.  Why?  I thought it was converted to VCard format with contains many more fields. Editing a Contact only shows a minimal number of fields compared to VCard. CardDAV just looks confusing and I can't tell what is what, and causes duplicates. So why is there no merge without duplicates if the same Name field is already on file.  I've tried to use tools like BirdieSync, but it just duplicates every dam contact causing a mess.  This is really a problem because computers are here to make life better not add more work. So, before I get rid of TB just what is down the road for this problem?  My phone Contact software should have a APP that connects to my PC and copies new contacts or updates contacts to the Thunderbird contacts and visa versa. If they are both using VCard what's the problem? PC to Phone and phone to PC, without Google or Microsoft data theft of my contacts. Any Ideas? </p>",download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,1586149;,bmazak
