What email provider do you use? </blockquote> <p><br> Any email you send via Thunderbird gmail pop or imap account is sent via the gmail smtp server, so gmail is well aware that you sent the message. It should appear in the webmail 'All Mail' account because the 'All Mail' stores all emails received and sent via your gmail address. If 'sent' then that email in the 'All Mail' folder should also have a 'Sent Mail' label. So nothing wrong with that part. </p><p>Any email sent via gmail webmail account using a browser will also appear in the gmail 'All Mail' folder and also in the 'Sent Mail' folder. </p><p>You say emails sent via the gmail webmail account appear in Thunderbird. Where do they appear? If in the 'Inbox' then as david has mentioned, you must be either Cc ing yourself or forwarding to gmail.  Is the hotmail account forwarding emails to the gmail account&nbsp;? If yes, then the email will appear in the gmail Inbox and therefore would get downloaded to the Inbox of the pop gmail mail account in Thunderbird. </p><p>You mention you are using pop gmail account in Thunderbird. </p> <ul><li> In 'Account Settings' &gt; 'Server Settings' for the gmail account </li><li> what does it say at the top right for 'Server Type'&nbsp;? </li></ul> <ul><li> Menu &gt; Help &gt; More Troubleshooting Information. </li><li> Scroll down to 'Mail and News Accounts' </li><li> Copy all the contents and paste the info intot his forum question OR upload an image showing the information. </li></ul>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

I would like to assist, but I cannot grasp what you're describing. As I understand, you're saying you send emails from a browser and they appear to have been sent from Thunderbird. There must be something I'm missing, but I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed. If you try again, maybe I'll see the light. Thank you. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0
