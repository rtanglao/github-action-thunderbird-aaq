TB no longer correctly reports whether or not I have emails waiting when I first log in.  The size of the emails doesn't appear to be relevant.  It may be as little as just a couple of lines of type or it may include attachments.  The length of time to download is about the same at anywhere from 20 seconds to 1+ minutes.  When I track it on the task manager, of the 4 images of TB there are always 2 images of TB seemingly active at the same time when I Get Message.  One image is very large while the other is much smaller relatively.  All of this with both the Scam Detection and Antivirus turned off.  After reading a number of the entries on the forum, I performed some of the steps suggested.  Here is a synopsis of what I did and what I saw. </p><pre>  Put TB in  SAFE mode.  Sent a message.  Did Get Message(GM).  Task manager showed only one large TB image active, not the usual two mentioned above.  Download was the usual long time.  Sent a second message and had the same results.  Turned off SAFE mode.  Did another Send and Get 2 more times.  Task manager showed the two images active.  Response times were slow.   Turned on SAFE mode again and repeated as above.  Results were the same - one active image and slow response.  </pre> <pre>  Started Windows 7 Pro in SAFE mode with internet.  Started task manager and TB in normal mode.  Sent a message. Did Get Message and the mail was downloaded immediately.  Sent a second message and had the same result. </pre> <pre> Started Windows in normal mode.  Turned off email antivirus and smart firewall features in Norton 360.  Repeated test scenario as above.  The results were the same as I stated in the begining of this submission.  </pre> <pre> If there is anything else I can add that would help me to get Thunderbird back to normal, please let me know. </pre>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",dobrphi
