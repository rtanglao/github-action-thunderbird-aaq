Today, I had a critical need to print an email (to PDF) and clicking the PRINT command on the FILE dropdown menu does nothing.  I have no idea what is causing this and need to find the solution.  I was able to save the file as HTML and print from that, but this is far from an ideal solution.   </p><p>I have essentially all the same software installed in the new laptop as I was running on the former, including ESET Smart Security Premium anti-virus and Malwarebytes Premium.  I never had an issue printing emails on the older laptop. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",maxherr
