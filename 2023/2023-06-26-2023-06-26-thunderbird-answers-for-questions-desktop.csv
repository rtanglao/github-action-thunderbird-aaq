If an IMAP account, click File&gt;offline&gt;download to save the messages to PC and then immediately create a Local Folder to copy them to. (you can also use the importexport addon to assist in this - or exit Thunderbird after download and use Windows File Explorer to copy from imapmail folder to Local Folders folder. )But first verify all folders are set for offline use by clicking the 'advanced' tab at synchronization&amp;storage </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Here are a few potential reasons and troubleshooting steps you can take: </p><p>Software Updates: Ensure that your operating system and installed software are up to date. Updates often include bug fixes and performance improvements that can resolve issues that might cause the need for frequent reboots. </p><p>Overheating: Check if your computer is overheating. Excessive heat can cause instability and crashes. Make sure the cooling system (fans, vents) is clean and functioning properly. You can use monitoring software to check the temperature of your CPU and take appropriate measures if it's running too hot. </p><p>Hardware Issues: Inspect your hardware components for any signs of malfunction. Faulty RAM, a failing hard drive, or a defective power supply can lead to frequent reboots. Running hardware diagnostics or consulting a professional technician can help identify and resolve any hardware-related problems. </p><p>Malware or Virus Infections: Perform a thorough scan of your system using reliable antivirus or anti-malware software. Malware infections can cause system instability and frequent crashes. Make sure your antivirus software is up to date and perform regular scans to keep your system protected. </p>",techguy150,false,0,0

Thunderbird is a mail client and aggregator collecting mail using the IMAP and POP mail protocols from existing mail accounts with internet email providers such a Gmail, Yahoo, GMX, Yandex and Outlook among many many others including ISP provided accounts that it is configured to connect to.   </p><p>I would personally configure the gmail workspace account in Thunderbird and continue working as I did in the past.  Email is email from that perspective.  The Thunderbird client would now have two accounts and all mail would just appear, so nothing would be lost.  This would work as would any forwarding arrangement with the provider so long as the provider does not close the email address. Depending on the arrangements with the previous provider it might be the account just closes and mail is bounced by them when your ""client"" stops their monthly subscription to whoever is supplying the service now.   </p><p>But that does not address your issue as you express it. </p><p>Google has a support article on how to do what your trying to do in the Gmail account. <a href=""https://support.google.com/mail/answer/21289?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/mail/answer/21289?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop</a> </p><p>Fundamentally  This is not a Thunderbird issue.  It is a google workspace configuration issue.  </p><p>Unless Thunderbird is running in the background anything done in Thunderbird to ""forward"" incoming mail will simply not happen, so I am not going into an detail about using filter to forward emails,  because fundamentally there are much more reliable ways of doing it. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
