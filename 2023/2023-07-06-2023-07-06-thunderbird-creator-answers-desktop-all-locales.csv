How do I set a default account to send with, UNLESS I specifically choose a different one? ie whenever I click ""Write"", I want it to use the same account every time, unless I manually choose a different one... Thought it always did this, but have sent a few emails recently, and they seem to have defaulted to the ""last used"" address. Thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",hornetster

I called my internet/email provider and they did all kinds of stuff to check if it was their problem and ruled things out and said it must be Thunderbird.  All of the email settings are correct.  I tried turning off my Norton from scanning outgoing email.  I'm stumped.  Outgoing server <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a>  Port 587.  Normal Password.  SSL/TLS.  When I try to send, it tries for awhile and then times out and says it can't connect to server. </p><p>I get incoming emails fine and all of my internet surfing works fine.  Started suddenly about a week ago. Thanks. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",khq0660

Some of these emails are legitimate emails, not Junk. </p><p>Or to put it another way. </p><p>If I log into my email host provider webmail interface I can see thousands of emails in the junk folder that Thunderbird has not pulled down.   </p><p>My email hosting company tells me there is a way to make thunderbird sync with all folders including the junk folder - to ensure I get all emails including Junk.  Is this right?  If so how do I do that? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",David724
