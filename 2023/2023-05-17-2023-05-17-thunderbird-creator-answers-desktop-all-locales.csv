If not, I have another version, with most of the emails on another computer.  Is there an easy way to copy it or move it to this computer? </p><p>I  was at one time fairly decent with computers (have my undergrad degree in computer science) but I am pushing 70 now and it has gotten a lot harder for me.

I have no antivirus software running and can see no regularities in which messages are getting corrupted.  The form of the corruption is that some of the message is retained, but without formatting and with some of the html code (I think, I confess I didn't look closely enough before trying properties, repair ... which did repair it to my surprise, I did try ctrl-U to see the source which showed nothing at all, not even what I could see in the normal view).   </p><p>I realise that this doesn't make this a very helpful report but the issue is serious enough that I thought I should report it.  I will watch carefully for future examples.  Is there anything that I should do to get more information assuming, as I fear, that I will see more of this?  For now do I just ignore suggestions to compact (I have that on manual) as there looks to be a suggestion that compacting has caused corruption in the past? </p><p>TIA, </p><p>Chris </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1581308;1581326;1581639;1581640;1581768;,cpsyctc
