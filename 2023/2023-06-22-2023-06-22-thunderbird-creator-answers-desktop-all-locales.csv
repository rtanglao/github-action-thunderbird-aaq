That is until last night, 20 June 2023, when Thunderbird suddenly stopped sending emails. It receives emails just fine, but suddenly stopped sending emails. My email service is through Spectrum, part of Charter Communications. </p><p>I spoke to technical support at Spectrum today, 21 June 2023. He checked my account and everything looked good.  He had me login to my email account via the Spectrum Webmail link. I logged and was able to send an email just fine.  Also, I have and iMac, iPhone, and iPad Pro. All of my Apple computer and both of my mobile devices send and receive emails just fine, no change there. </p><p>Spectrum tech support says it is not Spectrum and I should check with Thunderbird tech support. I him I had not upgraded Thunderbird since I installed version 102, so as far as Thunderbird goes, nothing has changed.  </p><p>That leaves me with the question, why did Thunderbird suddenly stop sending emails  and what changed? </p><p>Please help me out. I have to be able to send emails from my Windows 10 PC. </p><p>Thank you, </p><p>Randy Hayes chayes23@carolina.rr.com </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",chayes23
