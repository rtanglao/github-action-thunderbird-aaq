I had been using Outlook for about 20+ years.  since around the beginning of this year, I began to notice a glitch in the programme.  It 'eats' emails.  I have three email accounts and all are in TB.  I'll be in the Inbox of one account and suddenly it scroll-deletes emails.  My hands are neither on the mouse nor the keyboard.  If I'm fast enough, I can close TB down.  If I open it again, it will happen again.  The only means to correct this, it seems is to reboot the PC.  Happened again yesterday and scroll deleted roughly 150 emails. </p><p>To bring the emails back to the Inbox from the Trash, is to click one email at a time, it would seem.  In Outlook, I was able to right click on one email and drag down or up to select multi emails and move them back.  It seems this does not exist in TB, unless I am missing something. </p><p>Questions:  1. Is there a means to fix this 'scroll deleting' of emails? </p><p>2. Is there a means to right click and drag select emails in order to move them to another folder, versus Clt+click on each?   </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",HondoMan

That is until last night, 20 June 2023, when Thunderbird suddenly stopped sending emails. It receives emails just fine, but suddenly stopped sending emails. My email service is through Spectrum, part of Charter Communications. </p><p>I spoke to technical support at Spectrum today, 21 June 2023. He checked my account and everything looked good.  He had me login to my email account via the Spectrum Webmail link. I logged and was able to send an email just fine.  Also, I have and iMac, iPhone, and iPad Pro. All of my Apple computer and both of my mobile devices send and receive emails just fine, no change there. </p><p>Spectrum tech support says it is not Spectrum and I should check with Thunderbird tech support. I him I had not upgraded Thunderbird since I installed version 102, so as far as Thunderbird goes, nothing has changed.  </p><p>That leaves me with the question, why did Thunderbird suddenly stop sending emails  and what changed? </p><p>Please help me out. I have to be able to send emails from my Windows 10 PC. </p><p>Thank you, </p><p>Randy Hayes [removed email from public] </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",chayes23
