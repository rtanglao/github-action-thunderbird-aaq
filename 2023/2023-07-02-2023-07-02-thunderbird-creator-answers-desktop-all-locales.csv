So, I've decided to use Thunderbird again after years of stop using it. I download the installer, install it, run it, and try to login to my Google account. But, I get an error (refer the image attached). I'm sure I already enable IMAP in my Gmail settings, and very sure that I enter the correct password. </p><p>Also, I already Google this problem. Some of the solutions offered was to change the Authentication Method to be OAuth2. When I check, by default, OAuth2 is selected as the Authentication Method. </p><p>How can I fix this? </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1588186;,ikmal.workspace
