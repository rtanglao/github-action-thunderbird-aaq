At my office, I've had TB on for over a decade after I moved from another email client. I can keep emails that are literally, 10 years old. But, at home, my emails are automatically deleted after about 30, sometimes less if I get a lot of emails. I've played with every setting in TB and with no success.  I really need my emails to stay on TB for at least a year. Am I doing something wrong, or is it a email server issue. I have Charter (Spectrum) on all my computers. </p><p>Thanks, Dave </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1588208;1588218;1588223;1588261;1588279;,dwilson49

Some of the solutions offered was to change the Authentication Method to be OAuth2.
