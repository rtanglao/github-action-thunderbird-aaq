Since one of the accounts still works without issue, not clear what's going on? </p><p>Ubuntu 22.04 Thunderbird 102.11.0 (64-bit) </p><p>I think perhaps it's the email account add / configuration step for several reasons. Let's call the account that works ""A"" and the not-working broken account ""B"". Early on, I deleted the ""B"" account and have since been trying to get this to work again. During the ""add account"" step, I've let TB configure automatically, which yields the same server info as ""A"", so I don't think that's an issue; The settings that show up when attempting to add ""B"" (same as ""A"") are in a screenshot. After you click ""Done"", there's a pop up to get Yahoo's password. I enter this, then click yes to the agreement, and *immediately* get the authentication error (another screenshot). The speed of this error is what has me suspicious. It made me think some local files somehow have incorrect info. I tried clearing history (""everything"") and restarting, but same story. </p><p>Unfortunately, the earlier question doesn't have an answer. Any more clues about this? </p><p>Thanks in advance </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1584770;,ryantkoehler
