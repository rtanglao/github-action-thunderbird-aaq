I turned my old computer back on, copied the Thunderbird folder and then pasted it into the new Roaming directory and that seems to have worked. I did not see any option on the Mozilla site to install older versions of Thunderbird so I just left the version that had downloaded in the first place and it seems to be working with the old profile - all the Inbox subfolders and local folders loaded and populated and the filters seem to be working. So I think this is resolved. </p>",tonyalt1,false,0,0

In other words,  - go to C:/Users/(MyUserName)/AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles - copy all the files and subfolders of the profile I want to use (including all the address book, extension, history, ""impab"" files, etc.) - paste those files and subfolders into the default profile folder - say yes to all overwrite warnings </p><p>Is that right? If so, I have 2 further questions: 1. What is the difference between the ""default"" and ""default-release"" profiles? Does it matter which one I make the default before I paste over it? 2. Tbird has already imported all my 1000's of Gmail messages into the Inbox of the default profile. On my old system those messages were organized into dozens of Inbox subfolders, which were populated through message filters, and local folders. Once I overwrite the new profile with my backed-up profile will all that be reproduced? I don't want to end up with 1000's of messages in my Inbox that are already in subfolders (or deleted from them). </p><p>Really I have one more question that I hesitate to ask: Thunderbird has been around a long time. Why isn't there a simple way to do this? Like a startup switch, ""Create new profile or Browse to select existing profile""? I would have thought it was obvious that Thunderbird users who upgrade to a new computer might want to transfer their entire profile as is. I never expected to have to do all this file manipulation to accomplish it. </p>",tonyalt1,false,0,0

So you have to create a new profile in the location you have placed your old data to get it into the list, and get to use it. </p><p>I was suggesting the profile backup and restore,  but it looses all your passwords,  so is next to useless.  a year after launch and it is still a cripple. </p><p>Of course there is just a most basic way.  Go to the show profile button in the troubleshooting information on the help menu.  When the explorer window opens shut down Thunderbird and paste the contents of your old profile into the new folder. (note I said contents,  so don't past a copy of your old profile folder inside the new one)  It will get lots of ""replace"" errors which you need to accept to get your old data into the new profile,  but it ""just works"" because it is so crude. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0
