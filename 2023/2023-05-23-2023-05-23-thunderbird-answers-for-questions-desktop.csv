What I'm doing is copying the contents of the old profile into the newly created profile folder (after deleting the contents), so the ini file on the new PC is pointing to the correct profile folder, but the contents are different  I've used this process at least a dozen times and probably more on mine and clients PC's and it's worked flawlessly every time, even from Linux to Windows &amp; vice versa.   It worked fine on the portable TB install as well.   </p><p>Don't worry too much, the portable installation has fixed it anyway, but thanks again for your help. </p>",alansurry,false,0,0

This is because Thunderbird looks at the profiles.ini file at c:\users\&lt;yourid&gt;\appdata\roaming\thunderbird for the name of the profile. You might do better by using tools&gt;import&gt;import from another installation. That will put everything in sync. If there are no errors in profile, all should be okay. Very important that you created the copy when Thunderbird was not running. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I've found a workaround though by installing TB portable to a folder on the new PC and copying the profile to it.  I'm not sure why the usual installation approach won't work, but I've been dealing with Windows problems since Windows for Workstations 3.11 and NT4, so I'm tempted to blame Microsoft for some sort of permissions issue in copying to the app data folder in Windows 11.  The problem installation was pointing to the correct profile folder but for some reason was unable to read the contents of it.

The 'profile name' folder contains everything used when Thunderbird is started eg: all preferences, mail accounts, address books, calendar data etc etc etc. </p><p>Maybe you mean 'mail account' for an email address. </p><p>On Windows OS, by default Thunderbird profile has this structure: </p> <ul><li> C:/Users/ User Name/Appdata/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles/profile name/ </li></ul> <p>The 'profile name' folder is typically called something like this: 123asd2.default </p><p>The 'profile name' folder will cotain many files and folders including  'Mail and maybe 'ImapMail'. All Pop mail accounts will be located in the 'Mail' folder. All Imap accounts will be located in the 'ImapMail' folder. </p><p>Emails are stored in mbox text files. These files will have same name as folders which you would see in the Folder Pane.   These mbox files have no extension, so the file would just be called eg: 'Inbox' You may also see files with a *.msf extension. These are index files used by Thunderbird and they do NOT have any emails.  If you have an imap account and only see .msf files, (there are no mbox no extension files) it means you did not synchronise folders and do not have any copies of emails downloaded. You may aslo see some Folders with a.sbd extension. These are created when you create subfolders. These .sbd folders may also contain mbox files. </p><p>If you want to see those emails stored in the mbox no extension files then you need to get copies of them pasted into the 'Local Folders' mail account which is located in the 'Mail' folder. </p><p><strong>Info below on how to do this manually:</strong> </p> <ul><li> Exit Thunderbird </li><li> In Windows bottom search type: %Appdata% </li><li> Select the '%Appdata%' file folder </li><li> Select 'Roaming' </li><li> Select 'Thunderbird' folder  </li><li> Select 'Profiles' folder </li><li> Select 'profile name' folder </li><li> Select the 'Mail' folder </li><li> If you had previously used a pop account then maybe it has all those mbox files still intact, so right click on that pop account name folder and select to open in a new window - . </li></ul> <ul><li> Back in 'Mail' window </li><li> Select 'Local Folders' folder </li></ul> <p>Leave this window open on 'Local Folders' folder because this is where you need to paste copies of your mbox no extension files (and also copies of any .sbd folders). You cannot paste thes files into an imap mail account nor an exchange account. </p><p>If you did not open the pop account in another window, but want to use the backup you made: In a separate window - locate the backup copies of mbox no extension files. </p><p>Get copies of all mbox no extension files and also any .sbd folder and paste them into the 'Local Folders' folder.
