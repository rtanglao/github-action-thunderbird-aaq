I limped along with it being weird (David) has been helping me.  Yesterday I decided to wipe the whole thing, after backing up my profile to a usb stick.  I then installed a new copy of thunderbird, but accepted the default, which was imap.  My profile was in POP3.  I of course needed to change the imap to Pop, and couldn't.  I tried everything to delete the program again, but the hidden files kept catching me up. Today with no program on here (I thought) I made a search for hidden files that kept putting data back into the new install.  I though I had them all finally, about 1/2 hour ago, so downloaded a new install again.  Only it came back with old emails from April 3 and forward, so I'm trying to again get rid of Everything Thunderbird put anywhere on my machine so I can start with a clean install. I need to get to POP3.  I think if I can do that I can go forward properly.  I've removed my password so it can't connect to 3rd party, yet there's always something that causes the new install to open with my a/c name, and various other bits so I can't get to the right setup screen to choose POP3.  I've sent for help at each stage where I got stuck, that's why you couldn't follow me.  But now I just want a clean slate to completely start over.  I have the profile on the stick.

I tried to reproduce the error you're getting, by importing events from the same ics file, twice, into the same target calendar. The first import is successful because the target calendar is empty. The second import fails with that exact error, and the Error Console gives the exact reason why the import fails as follows: </p><p><code>There has been an error reading data for calendar: Home.  However, this error is believed to be minor, so the program will attempt to continue. <strong>Error code: DUPLICATE_ID. Description: ID already exists for addItem</strong></code> </p><p>The problem is the IDs of the events you're importing from the file are already in use by existing events in the target calendar. This ID is a unique identifier for each event, and therefore cannot be shared between events in the same database. In other words, duplicates of the ID are not allowed into the database. This therefore means you cannot simply import the same events on top of each other and overwrite the existing ones, thus eliminating duplicates and keeping only one entry of each event. Not in the current version of Thunderbird that I know of anyway. Thunderbird now uses SQlite as its database for calendar data storage. Perhaps there is an add-on for doing that. You could also file a feature request (enhancement request) to skip duplicate items here <a href=""http://bugzilla.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a> if one hasn't already been filed. </p><p>You may want to use an external tool to merge the ics files from the two calendars into one ics file, then import that into a new blank calendar. I can't offer any recommendations for such a tool as I've simply not had to do this before. Google Calendar apparently automatically merges duplicates. You could use that and then export the resultant calendar. </p>",stancestans,false,0,0

Addresses there mean that you only receive from those addresses.  Later I will get on the the Mac again and look further into this.  Now, I just realized that I should have written Monterey instead of Catalina.  Earlier I had to reinstall Catalina and upgrade to Monterey to make available video functions.  Now, I am on the Mac Monterey (not Catalina as indicated in the beginning).  For one thing, my Thunderbird did not come with a Spam folder; so I created one called Junk.  I do not know if that causes conflicts.  On my smartphones I only access my GMAIL, not my Comcast one.  In my Comcast account in the advanced email settings, I do not have use email safe list checked.  What is there is the email address my telephone provider requires for eFaxing.  So, as the technician explained yesterday, having that checked meant that I could send only to that address and expect a response, such as a cc: copy.  Unchecking that box made a difference because I now receive those copies and other messages that I regularly received.  Thank you. </p>",tightpurchaser,false,0,0

Thank God; otherwise I would have trouble with that address too!  Looking at your question in more detail, the From address is the same as the cc: field.  I am suspicious because someone might have tried to send messages to me who does that on a regular basis.  Those messages may have bounced.  The Get Message command does not seem to do anything.  In the Sent folder the cc: and the From fields show the Comcast address.  Comcast addresses end with @comcast.net while GMAIL ends with @gmail.com.  The Outgoing Server in Thunderbird under Account Settings is <a href=""http://smtp.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.comcast.net</a> and the Port is 465.
