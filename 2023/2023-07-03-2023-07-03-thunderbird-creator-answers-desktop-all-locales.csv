I get all the way to the last step when the process says it is verifying the password.  When that attempt ends I get the window shown in the attached screenshot. </p><p>This is a POP3 account.  After choosing that setting in TB, I see the screen with panels for entering port and connection security settings.  The POP3 setting auto-populates correctly (110, no security), but the SMTP port shows 25 when it should be 587 with no security.  The strange thing is that I cannot type the value in but must use the arrow keys to set the value. </p><p>After receiving the response in the screenshot, I reset the password at my ISP and received a message stating that the change was successful.  I copied and pasted the password from a notepad file in both TB and at my ISP to avoid typos.  I have no idea whether this is relevant to the problem but thought I'd add it just in case. </p><p>TIA for any help. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1588494;,rabbithutch1
