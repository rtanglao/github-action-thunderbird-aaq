I now have an indication that there is an unread message within one of my inbox folders but no message there.   The message has modest attachments.   Thunderbird now seems to be locked searching for the rest of that message and unable to move on to the next message in the inbox.   I  have received the offending message and subsequent ones on my Android phone and in the Windows Mail app.   Seems like I somehow need to delete this message from the queue somehow.   Any suggestions please&nbsp;? </p>,download-and-install_1;,thunderbird,download-install-and-migration,en-US,"",tony.watson56

Moving Thunderbird data to new computer failed!,"<p>Migrating my Thunderbird emails from my source computer to a destination computer failed. Both are Windows machines. Here's what I did: 1. I backed up my TB profile on my source computer. I did not copy the entire TB folder; I only copied the profile folder named a1kie4bp.default. 2. On my destination computer, I installed TB version 102.12.0. I launched the TB application and then closed it. This created the profile folder AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\2uvjpn58.default on my destination computer. (It also created \q971efhp.default-release there too.) 3. I then copied the contents of my backed up profile folder a1kie4bp.default into the new profile folder 2uvjpn58.default. But when I launched TB, it did not see my email data and went straight to the new account wizard. </p><p>BTW, the contents of AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\profiles.ini file is: </p><p>[InstallD78BF5DD33499EC2] Default=Profiles/q971efhp.default-release Locked=1 </p><p>[Profile1] Name=default IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/2uvjpn58.default Default=1 </p><p>[Profile0] Name=default-release IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/q971efhp.default-release </p><p>[General] StartWithLastProfile=1 Version=2 </p><p>What am I doing wrong? How can I restore my emails in the destination computer? Your help would be greatly appreciated.
