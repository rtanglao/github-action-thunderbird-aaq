Unfortunately, they didn't show up in deleted items nor in trash. But I found all mails on Outlook Web App under recover deleted mails. So I recovered all mails. So far, so good. Now I have all the mails back in OWA. But when I open Thunderbird again, the deleted mails do not show up. It seems that Thunderbird does not synchronize the folder. But now when I close Thunderbird again, all mails are deleted again. The previously recovered mails disappear again from the inbox of OWA and I have to recover them all again. </p><p>I have already tried several things. I created a new folder and moved the recovered mails to that folder. All in the hope that this folder will then sync properly. Unfortunately no. The folder does not sync and as soon as Thunderbird is closed again, all mails are also deleted again from the new folder on OWA. </p><p>I even reset Thunderbird and linked Thunderbird to the account again. Unfortunately, the same thing happens again. The recovered mails are not displayed in Thunderbird and after closing the program, the mails are deleted again in OWA and I have to recover them again. </p><p>Any suggestions? </p><p>Best regards </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",roman.lehmann

Moving Thunderbird data to new computer failed!,"<p>Migrating my Thunderbird emails from my source computer to a destination computer failed. Both are Windows machines. Here's what I did: 1. I backed up my TB profile on my source computer. I did not copy the entire TB folder; I only copied the profile folder named a1kie4bp.default. 2. On my destination computer, I installed TB version 102.12.0. I launched the TB application and then closed it. This created the profile folder AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\2uvjpn58.default on my destination computer. (It also created \q971efhp.default-release there too.) 3. I then copied the contents of my backed up profile folder a1kie4bp.default into the new profile folder 2uvjpn58.default. But when I launched TB, it did not see my email data and went straight to the new account wizard. </p><p>BTW, the contents of AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\profiles.ini file is: </p><p>[InstallD78BF5DD33499EC2] Default=Profiles/q971efhp.default-release Locked=1 </p><p>[Profile1] Name=default IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/2uvjpn58.default Default=1 </p><p>[Profile0] Name=default-release IsRelative=1 Path=Profiles/q971efhp.default-release </p><p>[General] StartWithLastProfile=1 Version=2 </p><p>What am I doing wrong?
