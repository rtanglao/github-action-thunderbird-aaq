Some messages suddenly (not on the initial reading, but on subsequent readings) have an erroneous Subject or Sender, and I recognize the (often garbled) content as belonging to another Subject or Sender. The problem is spurious: For instance, most e-mails from a particular Sender will read correctly, but every now and again a message appears garbled. When this happens, the From and Subject field will be empty when I open the message. (See attached images) These errors began when my e-mail provider Telenor (@online.no) started to upgrade their e-mail service a few months ago, and so far, they have not been able to pinpoint the cause or correct the problem. But all messages appear correctly on the server, so I suspect TB is not able to fetch and sort messages correctly. As a possible workaround: Is there a way to re-download a particular message to get a ""clean"" version of that particular message in TB? (I use TB version 102.11.2, Build ID 20230526152851). Thanks for your help&nbsp;:) </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",gelgjo

Basically the machine is a default Debian Bookworm installation. Changing the `layout.css.devPixelsPerPx` value didn't result in the expected behavior. Interestingly `mainline` Firefox / GTK based / Qt based applications are not affected and the problem (too small fontsize) is only there for Thunderbird. </p><p>I managed to find a workaround setting ``` GDK_DPI_SCALE=1.2 GDK_SCALE=1 ``` only for thunderbird e.g. by invoking it via ``` GDK_DPI_SCALE=1.2 GDK_SCALE=1 thunderbird ``` in the `.desktop` file. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,"",merkle.alexander

The duplicates are nearly always quite old (several months or even years). When Thunderbird does this there are always exactly two of each duplicate (never one). </p><p>I can't tell if the problem has something to do with filters or actual redundant server downloads. </p><p>I think this problem has occurred with both Pop and Imap accounts, but I've primarily noticed it in Pop accounts. </p><p>I run: Windows 7 Pro OS Thunderbird 102.11.0 (32-bit) on: <a href=""http://Sonic.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Sonic.net</a> Internet service </p><p>This is not a huge problem but it is an irritating interruption to getting work done smoothly. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Eric Brooks </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",brookse321
