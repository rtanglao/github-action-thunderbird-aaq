The duplicates are nearly always quite old (several months or even years). When Thunderbird does this there are always exactly two of each duplicate (never one). </p><p>I can't tell if the problem has something to do with filters or actual redundant server downloads. </p><p>I think this problem has occurred with both Pop and Imap accounts, but I've primarily noticed it in Pop accounts. </p><p>I run: Windows 7 Pro OS Thunderbird 102.11.0 (32-bit) on: <a href=""http://Sonic.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Sonic.net</a> Internet service </p><p>This is not a huge problem but it is an irritating interruption to getting work done smoothly. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Eric Brooks </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",brookse321
